<p>
In the summer of 1831 Audubon felt that he must
again return to America and extend his researches to
the north, south and west, as well as begin a campaign
for subscribers in the United States. His large folio
was now running into its second volume, and the first
installment of his text had been published; the time was
favorable to his plans, and he hoped to remain in the
country two or three years.
</p>

<p>
For the second time the publication of his plates
was entrusted to friend Children, and with Mrs. Audubon
he set sail for New York on August 2, 1831. From
the American metropolis he wrote to Joseph B. Kidd
on September 7 as follows:<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We landed on the 3d ... [of September] after a remarkably
fine passage of 33 days. In two days more I proceed
to the woods, and away from white man's tracks and
manners. I hope you are going on well with your work....
I have a new subscriber here. The papers and scientific
journals (we have not many,) are singing the praises of my
work, and, God willing, I may yet come out at the broad end
of the horn; at all events, I will either <i>break it or make a
spoon</i>! I shot sixteen birds on the passage, which I got through
the kind attention of our commander. I killed fifty more,
when the "Columbia" was going too fast to stop for the purpose
of picking them up. My young man is now busily engaged
in skinning, and killed a bag-full of warblers yesterday ...
prices of peaches, first quality, 75 cents per bushel,—apples,
half that price;—water melons are dull of sale, as also cantelopes
and nutmeg melons. Fish alive in the markets, and,
<i>vive la joie</i>, no taxes on shooting or fishing."
</p>
</div>

<p>
What Audubon actually did was to proceed to
Philadelphia, where Mrs. Audubon left him to visit her
sons in Louisville, and where he laid his plans for exploring
the Southern States, especially the islands and
eastern coast of the Florida peninsula. For this expedition
he engaged two assistants, one of whom was Henry
Ward, the "young man" mentioned above, an Englishman
who had come with him to America as taxidermist,
while the other was George Lehman, a Swiss landscape
painter whom he seems to have found at Philadelphia.
With them he soon started for Washington to obtain
assistance from the Government.
</p>

<p>
On the very day that Audubon landed in New York,
there appeared in the <i>London Literary Gazette</i> a serio-comic
notice under the title of "Wilson the Ornithologist,"
who, it may be remembered, had died in Philadelphia
eighteen years before. Said the editor of the
<i>Gazette</i>:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We observe with sorrow an account of the death and burial
of poor Wilson, somewhere in the state of Philadelphia, even
while the Edinburgh journals are anticipating his return, laden
with scientific treasures. We have now before us No. 1 of his
Illustrations of American Ornithology, on a reduced scale, to
sort with Professor Jameson's edition—a pretty and attractive
publication. The coloured prints are extremely correct
and well done.
</p>
</div>

<p>
When on September 8 the Edinburgh <i>Caledonian Mercury</i>
had called attention to this egregious blunder regarding
Wilson, the <i>Gazette</i> explained that his name
had been confused with that of Audubon, whose obituary
presently appeared in its issue of October 29, the
editor remarking that this naturalist's death was equally,
if not more, to be deplored than that of Wilson. Captain
Brown then sent to the <i>Caledonian Mercury</i> Audubon's
letter to Kidd, quoted above, which was written
from New York four days after the naturalist's death
was announced in England. "What is the editor of the
Literary Gazette about," exclaimed a writer in the Edinburgh
paper; "he first resuscitates a man who has been
dead 18 years, only to kill him again, and then, by way
of correcting his error, kills another, who is now clearly
proved to have been alive and well several days after
the date of his obituary in London."
</p>

<p>
As was often the case, Audubon's ambitious hopes
for exploring the continent far outran his means and
powers of accomplishment. Colonel John James
Abert, whose counsel he sought in Washington at this
time; said:<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> "His plan is first to examine the peninsula
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
of Florida; then the regions west of the Mississippi,
Mexico, and if possible penetrate into California. He
also contemplates crossing the Rocky Mountains and
pursuing the Columbia River to its mouth, and thinks
that he will be absent from us about two years." In
November G. W. Featherstonhaugh, the geologist, also
made this announcement in his <i>Monthly American Journal
of Geology and Natural Science</i>:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We are authorized to state that information of the progress
of Mr. Audubon will be given, from time to time, to the scientific
world, in the pages of this journal.
</p>

<p>
We are gratified in being able to state, that he was received
in the most cordial manner, at Washington, and that the distinguished
gentlemen in authority there, have given him such
letters to the military posts on the frontiers, as will assure
him the aid and protection his personal safety may require.
We anticipate the most interesting reconnaisances, both geological
and zoölogical, from this enterprising naturalist, who
is accompanied by Mr. Lehman, as an assistant draftsman, and
by an assistant collector who came with him from Europe.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The "distinguished gentlemen" at Washington who
particularly aided Audubon at this time, besides Colonel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
Abert, were Edward Everett, Levi Woodbury, Secretary
of the Navy, and Lewis McLane, Secretary of the
Treasury. He was particularly anxious to obtain accommodation
for his party aboard a government vessel,
but it was some time before a suitable one was available.
They left Washington about October 15, 1831, and went
by steamer to Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia, where
the Governor, John Floyd, whom Audubon had known
in his Kentucky days, gave him numerous letters of
introduction. At Charleston, their next stopping-place,
he had hardly begun work in the field when he was
sought out by the Rev. John Bachman, by inclination
a naturalist of the old school and by profession a Lutheran
minister, who at once took the whole party under
his hospitable roof, where they remained a month. Thus
began a life-long and almost ideal friendship between
these two men, so unlike in character, in temperament
and in training, which was quite as important to the
modest German-American divine as to the impulsive
Franco-American painter and student of birds. It was
Audubon's infectious enthusiasm which kindled to an
ardent flame that love of nature which was innate in
Bachman, and which eventually brought his name and
work to the attention of the scientific world.
</p>

<p>
Audubon remained at Charleston with the Bachmans
until November 15, when the opportunity which they
had awaited came suddenly, and they sailed for St. Augustine,
Florida, on the government schooner <i>Agnes</i>.
On that day Bachman wrote to Mrs. Audubon, in compliance
"with a request of your kind and worthy husband,
who laid an injunction on me this morning":<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The last has been one of the happiest months of my life.
I was an enthusiastic admirer of nature from my boyhood, and
fond of every branch of Natural History. Ornithology is, as
a science, pursued by very few persons—and by none in this
city. How gratifying was it, then, to become acquainted with
a man, who knew more about birds than any man now living—and
who, at the same time, was communicative, intelligent, and
amiable, to an extent seldom found associated in the same individual.
He has convinced me that I was but a novice in the
study; and besides receiving many lessons from him in Ornithology,
he has taught me how much can be accomplished by a
single individual, who will unite enthusiasm with industry. For
the short month he remained with my family, we were inseparable.
We were engaged in talking about Ornithology—in
collecting birds—in seeing them prepared, and in laying
plans for the accomplishment of that great work which he has
undertaken. Time passed rapidly away, and it seems but as
yesterday since we met, and now, alas! he is already separated
from me—and in all human probability we shall never meet
again.... I need not inform you that Mr. Audubon was
a general favorite in our city. His gentlemanly deportment,
his travels and experience, his information and general talents,
caused him to be sought after by all. But your husband
knew that the great objects before him required his unremitted
attention, and he was obliged to deny himself to his friends,
on many occasions, and devoted to them only his evenings.
</p>

<p>
There seems quite a blank, in my house, since he has gone,
for we looked on him as one of our family. He taught my
sister, Maria, to draw birds; and she has now such a passion
for it, that whilst I am writing, she is drawing a Bittern, put
up for her at daylight by Mr. Audubon.

<p>
On December 23 Bachman wrote to Audubon:
"Your visit to me gave me new life, induced me to go
carefully over my favorite study, and made me and my
family happy." His sister-in-law, Miss Maria Martin,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
who possessed considerable artistic talent, became one of
Audubon's enthusiastic helpers, and not only drew birds
for him but painted many of the flowers and insects
which were later used for the embellishment of his plates.
John Bachman's serious contributions to natural history
also date from this visit. To repay him and his family
for their hospitality, Audubon presented them with the
first volume of <i>The Birds of America</i>, but the folio was
not received until some time later; he was referring to
this when he wrote to Bachman, just before sailing from
New York, on April 5, 1834, and asked him to accept
"the superbly bound book" from "your old Friend, in
part atonement for the troubles I have given you, and
the leatherings you may yet receive at my hands at
chess." In a letter to Miss Martin, written also from
New York on the following day, he said: "The Great
Volume which Maj. Glassel did fortunately return into
your hands, I give with all my heart to my valued
friends, the Bachmans, and shall try to furnish them
the sequel in like binding."<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
Audubon scattered detached plates and numbers of
his large work freely among his friends, and sometimes
spoke of a gift of the whole. The costly nature of such
a present in most cases, no doubt, led to a change of
mind if not of heart, but not in all, for a number of his
presentation copies still exist. One was given to David
Eckley<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> of Boston, a noted sportsman who had aided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
Audubon in collecting materials for his work. In a
letter written at Charleston, January 1, 1837, to young
Thomas M. Brewer, Audubon said: "Please to call on
my good friend David Eckley, Esq., present to him and
to his family my very best regards, and ask of him
whether he has collected any hawks or owls for me. If
so, take them from him, and place them in the general
receptacle of 'pale-faced rum.'" Another copy is said
to be in possession of the Public Library of Manchester,
England, and to have been bequeathed to that institution
by the Earl of Crawford. A complete set of the
<i>Birds</i> was also presented to his friends, the Rathbones
of Liverpool, and is still in possession of the family.</p>
<p>
We shall now return to our narrative and fulfill our
promise of reproducing Audubon's own account of his
journey from Richmond to Florida:<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
</p>

<h4>
<i>Audubon to G. W. Featherstonhaugh</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I am now seated in earnest to give you an unceremonious
summary of my proceedings up to this time, since we left Richmond,
in Virginia. As a geologist, I venture to suppose you
would have been but indifferently amused, if you had been with
us in our journey from this latter place to Charleston, in
South Carolina; and as an ornithologist, I cannot boast of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
enjoyment I found; poor coaches, dragged through immense,
deserted pine forests, miserable fare, and neither birds nor
quadrupeds to be seen. We at length approached Charleston,
and the view of that city from across the bay was hailed by
our party with unfeigned delight. Charmed, as we were, with
having terminated our dreary journey, it did not occur to us
to anticipate the extraordinary hospitality which awaited us
there, and which led to a residence of a few of the happiest
weeks I ever passed.
</p>

<p>
I had passed but one night in the city, when I was presented
to the Rev. Mr. ——. This benevolent man, whom I am
proud to call my friend would not suffer the "American Woodsman"
to repose any where but under his roof; and not him
alone—all his assistants too. When I tell you that he was
an old friend of Alexander Wilson, that he shoots well, is an
ornithologist, a philosophical naturalist, and that during the
time we enjoyed his hospitality, he took us all over the country
with his carriages and servants, in search of specimens, and
that he was every thing a kind brother could be to me, you
may suppose that it is with great sincerity I say, and ever
shall say, God bless him! When I first saw this excellent man,
he was on horseback, but upon my being named to him, he
leaped from his saddle, suffered his horse to stand at liberty,
and gave me his hand with a pressure of cordiality that electrified
me. I saw in his eyes that all he said was good and
true; and although he spoke of my labours in terms far exceeding
what is due to them, I listened to him pretty well assured
that he did not intend me to play the part of Gil Blas
over again; for myself, my assistants, George Lehman and
Henry Ward, were removed in a jiffy to his own mansion, introduced
to the family, and at work the very next morning.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Although the weather was "shockingly hot," they
prepared three hundred specimens, embracing about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
sixty land and water birds, and sent all the "pickled
specimens to our mutual friend H——" [Dr. Harlan, of
Philadelphia] for safe keeping until their return.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I jumped at once into my wood-hunting habits. All hands
of us were up before day-break, and soon at work, either in
the way of shooting, taking views, or drawing birds; after
sunset—scribbling in our journals.... In the early part of
November the alligators had gone into their winter quarters;
the migratory birds were passing swiftly on towards the south,
although we had had no frost. The planters considered the
country as still unhealthy, and resorted to the city at night.
If I had been governed by the practice and advice of many, I
should not have put a foot in the mud, either salted or fresh; but
difficulties of this character must be disregarded by the American
woodsman, while success, or the hope of it, is before him.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to do justice to the generous feelings of
the Charlestonians, or to their extreme kindness towards me.
Many of the gentlemen took the greatest interest in my pursuits;
one, Dr. ——, presented me with an excellent New
Foundland dog, and other valuable memorials of his regard.
Another, Dr. ——, gave me a collection of shells, from the adjacent
waters. The ladies presented me with a capital supply of
snuff.<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> Desirous of going to Cole's Island, distant about 25 or
30 miles, to look after some marine birds, a boat, four hands
and a pilot, were immediately offered to me, free of all expense,
with the liberty to detain them as long as was agreeable
to me. It is not possible for me to express properly the
sense I feel of the kindness I received from that warm-hearted
and intelligent people.
</p>

<p>
And now, as you have good naturedly listened to what I
have felt bound to say on the score of gratitude, I will tell you
what I know you are impatient to come to—something about
my proceedings at Cole's Island. It lies south from Charleston
about 25 or 30 miles; there we arrived and encamped for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
night: certain beef-steaks we brought with us we roasted upon
sticks, and the adjacent shore provided us with excellent
oysters: gaiety, good appetites, and our hearts all right, made
the time pass pleasantly, and it was with some reluctance we
spread our blankets, and arranged the fire preparatory to going
to rest. Nothing is more valuable to a naturalist, and
particularly to an ornithologist, than the first hours of the
day; therefore, long ere the sun had glowed over the broad
sea that lay before our camp, we had reached another island
where birds resort to roost by thousands; but, notwithstanding
these multitudes, not a new species did we procure. We, however,
had the pleasure of observing two noble "birds of Washington,"<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
sailing majestically over the broad watery face.
</p>

<p>
But it was necessary to bring my stay in Charleston to a
close, and it was somewhat difficult too. My friends had increased
in number; they were in the habit of accompanying
me in my shooting excursions; I was becoming very much attached
to them; invitations poured in from various parts of the
country; and I really believe that had I been willing, we might
have remained there and in the neighborhood, if not all our
lives, at least as long as would have caused a rare scarcity of
the feathered tribes, in that portion of the Carolinas. But
my mind was among the birds farther south,—the Floridas,
Red River, the Arkansas, that almost unknown country, California,
and the Pacific ocean. I felt myself drawn to the untried
scenes of those countries, and it was necessary to tear myself
away from the kindest friends.
</p>

<p>
We embarked on the schooner Agnes; the wind was fair,
and we hoisted all sails for the Floridas. Our passage was
not short; the wind changed, and we put back into St. Simon's
Island Bay. This was one of the few put backs in life of a
fortunate kind for me. I made for the shore, met a gentleman
on the beach, presented him my card, and was immediately
invited to dinner. I visited his gardens, got into such agreeable
conversation and quarters, that I was fain to think that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
I had landed on some one of those fairy islands said to
have existed in the golden age. But this was not all; the owner
of this hospitable mansion pressed me to stay a month with him,
and subscribed to my Birds of America in the most gentlemanly
manner. This was T. B. K., Esq.<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> But the wind
shifted; I was sent for, and our voyage to St. Augustine resumed.
</p>

<p>
St. Augustine, whatever it may have been, is far from being
a flourishing place now. It lies at the bottom of a bay,
extremely difficult of access, even for vessels of light draft,
which seldom reach the "city" in less than a day. I cannot say
much for the market, nor for the circumjacent country.
Oranges and plenty of good fish seem to contribute the wealth
of the place. Sands, poor pine forests, and impenetrable thickets
of cactus and palmettos form the undergrowth. Birds are
rare, and very shy; and with all our exertions, we have not
collected one hundred skins in a fortnight that we have been
here. I have received many kind attentions, and numerous
invitations to visit plantations, on our way to the south, where I
shall direct my steps in a few days. I have drawn seventeen
species, among which one <i>mongrel vulture</i>, which I think will
prove new. You will see it, I hope, very soon.
</p>

<p>
I will give you a sketch of our manner of passing the time.
We are up before day, and our toilette is soon made. If
the day is to be spent at drawing, Lehman and I take a walk,
and Ward, his gun, dog, and basket, returning when hungry
or fatigued, or both. We draw uninterruptedly till dusk,
after which, another walk, then write up journals, and retire to
rest early. When we have nothing on hand to draw, the guns
are cleaned over night, a basket of bread and cheese, a bottle
with old whiskey, and some water, is prepared. We get into
a boat, and after an hour of hard rowing, we find ourselves in
the middle of most extensive marshes, as far as the eye can
reach. The boat is anchored, and we go wading through
mud and water, amid myriads of sand-flies and mosquitoes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
shooting here and there a bird, or squatting down on our hams
for half an hour, to observe the ways of the beautiful beings
we are in pursuit of. This is the way in which we spend the
day. At the approach of evening, the cranes, herons, pelicans,
curlews, and the trains of blackbirds are passing high over our
heads, to their roosting places; then we also return to ours.
If some species are to draw the next day, and the weather is
warm, they are <i>outlined</i> that same evening, to save them from
incipient putridity. I have ascertained that <i>feathers</i> lose their
brilliancy almost as rapidly as flesh or skin itself, and am of
opinion that a bird alive is 75 per cent more rich in colours
than twenty-four hours after its death; we therefore skin
those first which have been first killed, and the same evening.
All this, added to our other avocations, brings us into the night
pretty well fatigued. Such, my dear friend, is the life of an
active naturalist; and such, in my opinion, it ought to be. It
is nonsense ever to hope to see in the closet what is only to
be perceived—as far as the laws, arrangements and beauties of
ornithological nature is concerned,—by that devotion of time,
opportunities, and action, to which I have consecrated my
life, not without hope that science may benefit by my labours.
</p>

<p>
As to geology, my dear Friend, you know as well as myself,
that I am not in the country for that. The instructions
you gave me are very valuable, and I shall be vigilant. The
aspect of the country will soon begin to change, and as I proceed,
I will write to you about all we see and do.... Do not
be afraid of my safety; I take a reasonable care of my health
and life. I know how to guard against real difficulties, and
I have no time to attend to that worst of all kinds of difficulties,—imaginary
ones. Circumstances never within my control,
threw me upon my own resources, at a very early period
of my life. I have grown up in the school of adversity, and
am not an unprofitable scholar there, having learnt to be satisfied
with providing for my family and myself by my own exertions.
The life I lead is my vocation, full of smooth and rough
paths, like every vocation which men variously try. My physical
constitution has always been good, and the fine flow of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
spirits I have, has often greatly assisted me in some of the most
trying passages of my life. I know I am engaged in an arduous
undertaking; but if I live to complete it, I will offer to my
country a beautiful monument of the varied splendour of American
nature, and of my devotion to American ornithology.

On the following day, December 8, 1831, Audubon
sent the following request to Dr. Harlan of Philadelphia:
"I wish you also to send me—to Key West—, 20
more pounds of powdered arsenic from Friend Wetherell's
shop,<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> and also a double barelled gun of usual
length, as good as you can procure for 30 dollars; probably
a second hand one may be procured; it must be
<i>percussion</i> and, if possible, <i>back action</i>." Dr. Richard
Harlan, who often transmitted to Mrs. Audubon any
news which came direct from her husband, wrote to her
on December 10, 1831, as follows:<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>

<p>
The winter season at St. Augustine proved unfavorable
for the naturalist's work, and he anxiously awaited
the coming of the government vessel, the <i>Spark</i>, to the
commander of which he bore letters from Washington.
After spending about three weeks in the neighborhood
of the city, the party proceeded through the inlet which
divides Anastasia Island from the mainland, to the
plantation of General Hernandez, thirty-five miles distant,
where they were entertained for ten days. On
Christmas morning they set out afoot for the plantation
of John Bulow, of Bulowville, fifteen miles away. To
follow the naturalist's account:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A wagon was sent for our baggage and horses for ourselves
were offered at the same time, but it was not my desire
to give unnecessary trouble, and above all upon an occasion
when I was glad to see the country in as much detail as possible,
and anxious to avail myself of every occasion to get new
birds.
</p>

<p>
During the whole long stay with Mr. Bulow, there was no
abatement of his kindness, or his unremitted efforts to make me
comfortable, and to promote my researches. I shall ever feel
grateful to one of the most deserving and generous of men.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On December 28 their host proposed that they should
descend the Halifax River in search of new and valuable
birds to a point about forty miles from that place
and eighty miles from St. Augustine.<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Accordingly, the boat, six hands, and "<i>three white men</i>,"
with some provisions, put off with a fair wind, and a pure sky....
We meandered down a creek for about eleven miles—the
water torpid yet clear—the shore lined with thousands of
acres covered by fall grapes, marshes, and high palm trees,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
rendering the shore quite novel to my anxious eye. Some birds
were shot, and secured so as to be brought back, in order to
undergo the <i>skinning operation</i>. Before long we entered the
Halifax river, an inland arm of the sea, measuring in breadth
from a quarter to nearly a mile.
</p>
</div>

<p>
They reached a spot, called "Live Oak Landing,"
where a schooner from New York was then anchored,
and there passed the night.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At sunrise the next morning, I and four negro servants
proceeded in search of birds and adventures. The fact is,
that I was anxious to kill some 25 brown Pelicans ... to
enable me to make a new drawing of an adult male bird, and
to procure the dresses of the others. I proceeded along a
narrow, shallow bay, where the fish were truly abundant. Would
you believe it, if I were to say, that the fish nearly obstructed
our head-way? Believe it, or not, so it was; the waters were
filled with them, large and small. I shot some rare birds, and
putting along the shore, passed a point, when lo, I came in
sight of several hundred pelicans, perched on the branches
of mangrove trees, seated in comfortable harmony, as near each
other as the strength of the boughs would allow. I ordered to
back water gently; the hands backed water. I waded to the
shore under cover of the rushes along it, saw the pelecans fast
asleep, examined their countenances and deportment well and
leisurely, and after all, levelled, fired my piece, and dropped
two of the finest specimens I ever saw. I really believe I would
have shot one hundred of these reverend sirs, had not a mistake
taken place in the reloading of my gun. A mistake, however,
did take place, and to my utmost disappointment, I saw
each pelecan, old and young, leave his perch, and take to
wing, soaring off, well pleased, I dare say, at making so good
an escape from so dangerous a foe.
</p>
</div>

<p>
After shooting more birds, and pushing or pulling
their boat "over oyster banks sharp as razors," they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
made the schooner at the landing again. "The birds,
generally speaking," he continues, "appeared wild and
few—you must be aware that I call birds few, when I
shoot less than one hundred per day."
</p>

<p>
Such remarks as we have just quoted might convey
the impression that the American woodsman, with whose
name the cause of bird protection is now associated in
this country, was a reckless destroyer of all bird life,
but this was far from the case. It must be remembered
that this was over eighty years ago, when the unrivaled
abundance of our birds was such that the necessity of
their conservation had hardly entered the dreams of the
most discerning. Audubon no doubt had gradually
yielded to the prevalent mania for describing and figuring
new species, and to make out all the minute specific
differences a large series of specimens was necessary;
still more were needed for the detection of individual
variation, which did not escape him, and much less his
assistant, William MacGillivray, who demanded large
numbers for his anatomical studies. Furthermore,
Audubon counted upon defraying a part of his expenses
by collections of skins of American birds, which were
then desiderata among the museums of Europe.<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a>
</p>

<p>
When it was proposed that they should return,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
preparations were accordingly made, and we left the schooner,
with tide and wind in our teeth, and with the prospect of a
severe, cold night. Our hands pulled well, and our bark was
as light as our hearts. All went on merrily until dark night
came on. The wind freshening, the cold augmenting, the provisions
diminishing, the waters lowering, all—all depreciating
except our enterprising dispositions. We found ourselves fast
in the mud about 300 yards from a marshy shore, without the
least hope of being able to raise a fire, for no trees except palm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
trees were near, and the <i>grand diable</i> himself could not burn
one of them. Our minds were soon made up to do—what?
Why, to roll ourselves in our cloaks, and lay down, the best way
we could, at the bottom of our light and beautiful barque.
Good God, what a night! To sleep was impossible; the cold increased
with the breeze, and every moment seemed an hour,
from the time we stretched ourselves down until the first glimpse
of the morn; but the morn came, clear as ever morn was, and
the north-easter as cold as ever wind blew in this latitude. All
hands half dead, and masters as nearly exhausted as the hands—stiffened
with cold, light-clothed, and but slight hope of our
nearing any shore; our only resort was, to leap into the mire,
waste-deep, and to push the barque to a point, some five hundred
or six hundred yards, where a few scrubby trees seem to
have grown to save our lives on this occasion. "Push, boys,
push! Push for your lives!", cry the generous Bulow, and the
poor Audubon.—"All hands push!" Aye and well might we
push: the mire was up to our breasts, our limbs becoming
stiffened at every step we took. Our progress was slowly performed
as if we had been clogged with heavy chains. It took
us two and a half hours to reach the point, where the few
trees of which I have spoken were; but, thank God, we did get
there.
</p>

<p>
<i>We landed</i> ... and well it was that we did; for on reaching
the margin of the marsh, two of the negroes fell down in
the marsh, as senseless as torpidity ever rendered an alligator,
or a snake; and had we, <i>the white men</i>, not been there, they
certainly would have died. We had carried them into the little
grove, to which, I believe, all of us owe our lives. I struck a
fire in a crack; and, in five minutes, I saw, with indescribable
pleasure, the bright, warming blaze in a log pile in the center
of our shivering party. We wrapped the negroes in their blankets—boiled
some water, and soon had some tea—made them
swallow it, and with care revived them into animation. May
God preserve you from being ever in the condition of our
party at this juncture; scarcely a man able to stand, and the
cold wind blowing as keenly as ever. Our men, however, gradually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
revived—the trees, one after another, fell under the
hatchet, and increased our fire—and in two hours I had the
pleasure of seeing cheerful faces again.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Their predicament, however, was still serious, for, to
continue the narrative, they were
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
confined in a large salt marsh, with rushes head high, and
miry; no provisions left, and fifteen miles from the house of
their host.
</p>

<p>
Not a moment was to be lost, for I foresaw that the next
night would prove much colder still. The boat was manned
once more, and off through the mud we moved to double the
point, and enter the creek, of which I have spoken, with the
hope that in it we should find water enough to float her. It did
happen so, thank God! As we once more saw our barque afloat,
our spirits rose,—and rose to such a pitch that we in fun set
fire to the whole marsh: crack, crack, crack! went the reeds,
with a rapid blaze. We saw the marsh rabbits, scampering
from the fire by the thousands, as we pulled our oars.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Their pleasure in being afloat was short-lived, for
"the northeaster had well nigh emptied the creek of its
usual quantum of water," and they were again obliged
to wade to effect a landing, their object being to gain
the east Florida coast and thus make their escape. This
was finally attained after abandoning their boat, when
began a long tramp on the beach, in the teeth of the
wind,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
through sand that sent our feet back six inches at every step
of two feet that we made. Well, through this sand we all
<i>waded</i>, for many a long mile, picking up here and there a shell
that is nowhere else to be found, until we reached the landing
place of J. J. Bulow. Now, my heart, cheer up once more, for
the sake of my most kind host.... I assure you, I was glad
to see him nearing his own comfortable roof; and as we saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
the large house opening to view, across his immense plantation,
I anticipated a good dinner with as much pleasure as I ever
experienced.
</p>

<p>
All hands returned alive; refreshments and good care have
made us all well again, unless it be the stiffness occasioned in
my left leg, by nearly six weeks of daily wading through
swamps and salt marshes, or scrambling through the vilest
thickets of scrubly live oaks and palmitoes that appear to have
been created for no other purpose but to punish us for our
sins.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Readers of the following account who have visited
eastern Florida may conclude that Audubon was not a
good prophet, but probably at that early day no one
could have made a better forecast of the future:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The land, if land it can be called, is generally so very sandy
that nothing can be raised upon it. The swamps are the only
spots that afford a fair chance for cultivation; the swamps,
then, are positively the only places where plantations are to
be found. These plantations are even few in number; along
the coast from St. Augustine to Cape Carnaveral, there are
about a dozen. These, with the exception of two or three, are
yet young plantations. General Hernandez's, J. J. Bulow's,
and Mr. Durham's are the strongest, and perhaps the best.
Sugar cane will prosper, and doubtless do well; but the labour
necessary to produce a good crop, is great! great!! great!!!
Between the swamps of which I now speak, and which are found
along the margin laying west of the sea inlet, that divides <i>the
main land</i> from the Atlantic, to the river St. John of the interior
of the peninsula, nothing exists but barren pine lands
of poor timber, and immense savannas, mostly overflowed, and
all unfit for cultivation. That growth, which in any other
country is called underwood, scarcely exists; the land being
covered with low palmitoes, or very low, thickly branched
dwarf oaks, almost impenetrable to man. The climate is of
a most unsettled nature, at least at this season. The thermometer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
has made leaps from 30 to 89 degrees in 24 hours, cold,
warm, sandy, muddy, watery,—all these varieties may be seen
in one day's travelling.... Game and fish, it is true, are
abundant; but the body of valuable tillable land is too small to
enable the peninsula ever to become a rich state.

<p>
On January 6, 1832, the party started to visit a
famous spring near the sources of the St. John's River,
which was described in his third letter to Featherstonhaugh
as well as in a later "Episode."<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> There his host,
Colonel Rees, who utilized the abundant flow from this
curious spring for grinding the whole of his sugar cane,
took them down the Spring Garden Creek to a series
of muddy lakes which emptied into the St. John's. The
mud on this occasion was the cause of great disappointment
to the naturalist, for it made it impossible for him
to recover what he believed to represent a new species of
Ibis, which was shot in one of those bottomless pits.
"Being only a few yards distant from us," to quote from
Audubon's third letter,<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> "and quite near enough to
ascertain the extent of my loss, I submitted to lose a
fine pair of a new species, the which if I ever fall in
with it again, I shall call <i>Tantalus fuscus</i>."
</p>

<p>
When they had reached the borders of Woodruff's
Lake, after noon, fatigued and hungry, he continued:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We landed on a small island of a few acres, covered with a
grove of sour orange trees, intermixed with not a few live
oaks. The oranges were in great profusion on the trees—everything
about us was calm and beautiful and motionless, as if
it had just come from the hand of the Creator. It would have
been a perfect Paradise for a poet, but I was not fit to be in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
Paradise; the loss of my ibis made me as sour as the oranges
that hung about me. I felt unquiet, too, in this singular scene,
as if I were almost upon the verge of creation, where realities
were tapering off into nothing. The general wildness the eternal
labyrinths of waters and marshes, interlocked, and apparently
never ending; the whole surrounded by interminable swamps—all
these things had a tendency to depress my spirits, notwithstanding
some beautiful flowers, rich looking fruits, a pure sky,
and ample sheets of water at my feet. Here I am in the Floridas,
thought I, a country that received its name from the odours
wafted from the orange groves, to the boats of the first discoverers,
and which from my childhood I have consecrated in
my imagination as the garden of the United States. A garden,
where all that is not mud, mud, mud, is sand, sand, sand;
where the fruit is so sour that it is not eatable, and where
in place of singing birds and golden fishes, you have a species
of ibis that you cannot get when you have shot it, and alligators,
snakes, and scorpions.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bartram was the first to call this a garden, but he is
to be forgiven; he was an enthusiastic botanist, and rare plants,
in the eyes of such a man, convert a wilderness at once into a
garden.
</p>

<p>
When we had eaten our humble repast at the sweet little
Orange Grove Island, we left it "alone with its glory," but not
without a name. It was determined, nolens volens, that it
should be called Audubon's Island, on the St. John's river.
Lat. 29° 42´.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Early in February, 1832, Lieutenant Piercy took
Audubon and his assistants aboard the government
schooner <i>Spark</i> at St. Augustine, and sailed for the
mouth of the St. John's River, which he had orders to
ascend in the interests of the Revenue Service. On February
12, when they had reached a point one hundred
miles from the mouth of the river, the vessel, being in
need of repairs, was suddenly recalled. Audubon, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
two men, thereupon engaged a boat and attempted to
return to St. Augustine across country, by a short cut
to the eastward. They were soon stranded and the party
divided. Audubon with his dog and one companion then
endeavored to make their way by land to the town,
eighteen miles distant, but they were overtaken by a
terrific gale and thunder-storm, and in order to keep to
the trails were often obliged to grope their way on hands
and knees.<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a>
</p>

<p>
At about this time the publishers of the <i>Journal of
Geology and Natural Science</i>, from which we have
quoted, failed, and Featherstonhaugh, who assumed
their debts to all subscribers, was obliged to bring it to a
close with the completion of the first volume; Audubon's
third and last letter appeared in the valedictory
number for June, 1832.
</p>

<p>
Again the naturalist applied to the government officials
at Washington for assistance, and, as the following
letter shows, Edward Everett again came to his aid, as
did also Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Navy, to
whom Audubon later received a personal introduction
from Chief Justice Taney of the Supreme Court:

Finally, on April 15, 1832, Audubon and his party
were able to board the revenue cutter <i>Marion</i>, commanded
by Robert Day, and the opportunity thus afforded
for exploring the dangerous east Florida coast
amply repaid them for their long and vexatious delays.
They visited the islands from St. Augustine to Key
West, and examined every part of the shore which it was
the duty of the <i>Marion</i> to approach. At Indian Key
the deputy collector, Mr. Thurston, gave Audubon the
services of his pilot, a veteran sailor and hunter, who
accompanied him on the <i>Marion</i> for a number of weeks
and led many boat journeys to lonely islands, where
vast colonies of sea fowl then dwelt in undisputed possession.
The leisurely movements of the vessel also enabled
the naturalist to produce many finished drawings,
and to obtain materials for fresh "Episodes."<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> At Key
West Audubon was hospitably received by Major Classel,<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>
and by Dr. Strobel, who was of great assistance
both to him and to Bachman in procuring new birds
from that little known point.
</p>

<p>
The unexpected delays experienced in Florida, and
the expense which the presence of his assistants necessarily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
entailed, in all probability, deterred the naturalist
from the more hazardous and uncertain enterprise of
attempting to reach the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific
Coast, which for years had been the great object of
his ambition. At all events, after their work was finished
at Key West, the party returned to St. Augustine,
and on the fifth day of March again boarded the packet
schooner <i>Agnes</i>, which was to bear them with their collections
to Charleston. Audubon, however, left the vessel
at Savannah, in order to deliver letters from the
Rathbones of Liverpool to a number of their rich merchant
friends in the former city. One of these, named
William Gaston,<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> at first declined to subscribe to <i>The
Birds of America</i>, on the ground of its great expense
and the demands made upon his purse by charity, but
his indifference was quickly overcome: not only did he
write his name on Audubon's list, but he immediately
went out and obtained three other subscribers; he even
insisted on becoming Audubon's agent at Savannah, and
saw to it that none of those subscriptions was ever allowed
to lapse in after years. Savannah eventually
gave him six subscribers, which was more than were
credited to either Philadelphia or Baltimore.
</p>

<p>
At Charleston the party disbanded. Lehman returned
to Philadelphia, whither Audubon later followed
him, but Henry Ward obtained a position with the
Museum of Natural History, in which Bachman was
interested, and he appears to have been of much assistance
both to Bachman and to his friend in procuring for
them specimens of new or desirable birds and mammals;
at a later day, however, he seems to have fallen into disesteem
on account of unpaid debts.

<p>
Foiled in his attempt to see the Florida coast at the
season best suited to his purposes, and disappointed in
his ambition to penetrate to the Far West, Audubon now
turned his attention to the East and determined to follow
the migratory birds to their summer homes in the North
Atlantic. He left Charleston in early June, 1832, and
went to Philadelphia,<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> where he remained about a month,
waiting, it seems, for his wife and two sons to join him.
In a letter to Edward Harris, dated at Philadelphia,
June 9, 1832, he said that he had left the "National
hotel, on account of the too high price, I found I would
have to pay there, and removed to Camden, at a Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
Armstrong's, where I formerly boarded"; he asked
Harris to send him "a pair of fine woodchucks," as he
wished to secure a drawing of those animals.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to notice that while Audubon had
been absent in Florida, his friend Bachman had busied
himself in his behalf and eventually succeeded in placing
three copies of <i>The Birds of America</i> in public institutions
in Charleston. On December 23, 1831, he wrote
to Audubon, who was then at St. Augustine:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I arrived in Columbia, S. C., almost too late, for the
"House" had just resolved that the State was too poor to
subscribe for Audubon's work. I felt that it would be a disgrace
to the State; and, for the first time in my life, I turned
to electioneering. And now, behold me among the back countrymen,
spinning long yarns. The thing however, took, and
your book is subscribed for.... I read what was said in
your favor with regard to the "Rattlesnake Story," and thus
far, they have not found a wrong twist in your yarn; but be
careful in describing the wonders of the South and West.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon wrote to Bachman from Philadelphia, July
1, 1832: "G. Ord has caused a most violent attack on
my veracity to be inserted in a London journal; how
will he stand <i>mine eye</i>, on Tuesday next at the Society,
is more than I can at present tell.... Mr. Berthoud
will ship you 3 volumes of the Birds of America, and
the succeeding numbers; he will send a bill of sale of
those."
</p>

<p>
His plan was now to visit Boston and Maine, and
he left Philadelphia with his family in early August;
they traveled by stage to New York, but upon finding
that the city was then suffering from a periodic scourge
of the cholera, tarried but a day and hastened on. The
following letter which Richard Harlan sent after his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
friend in August of this year shows that his own city did
not escape the pest:

you to the care of M<span class="sup">r</span> Berthoud, the day after your departure.
I have since forwarded two others one from N. Orleans, also to
care of M<span class="sup">r.</span> Berthoud—The Cholera has raged dreadfully in
some localities here—I was engaged on Monday superintending
the removal of the sick prisoners from the jail in arch S<span class="sup">t.</span> at the
request of the City authorities—I was there three times during
the day—60 were sick at one time, the suffering, and agony
of the dying wretches, was an awful sight to witness, 26 died
there that day, and about as many more who were removed
to the various local Hospitals—I have treated altogether up
to present date 35—of whom 18 from prison. 16 have died—and
only one remains today—my success is rather encouraging
considering the <i>habits</i> of the poor wretches whose cases fell
under my care—most of the fatal cases were in a dying state
when admitted—I would not have rec<span class="sup">d.</span> them, but for the wish
to alleviate suffering and scatter the tenants of the infected
rooms of the jail—The Newspapers do not give an accurate
account, because numbers are cured in the early stages whose
cases are never reported—the statements of deaths are more
accurate—and I suppose the greatest mortality has not exceeded
100 per diem—today only 26 deaths reported, there
will probably be more tomorrow—I am happy to hear of yr.

Audubon's visit to Boston in the summer of 1832
was a red-letter period in his career. So warmly was he
then welcomed by the leading public and professional
men of the city that he could never say enough in praise
of the Bostonians. Dr. George Parkman, Dr. George
C. Shattuck, and Col. Thomas H. Perkins,<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> who was
already one of his subscribers, were among his most enthusiastic
supporters. Of Parkman Audubon said: "He
it is, whose memory is most dear to me." It was doubtless
Parkman, then a professor in the Medical School,
who introduced Audubon to the president of Harvard
University, Josiah Quincy, whose name was added to
his list.
</p>

<p>
On August 14, shortly after reaching Boston, Audubon
wrote to his friend Harris:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We left Camden, pushed by the season, and the desire I
have to fulfil towards my subscribers, the world, and indeed
myself, the task allotted me by nature,—the completion of
my work.... Allow me to say that with my work, as in the
days of '76, the Bostonians have proved themselves the best
supporters of a good cause in the country. We expect the
support of the Cambridge University, that of the Natural History
Society, &amp; again of the State! (Pray remember how
anxious we are to have all the States.)
</p>

<p>
I made drawings of 3 rare species; one is the Marsh Wren,
for which I searched in vain when near Salem; the 2d. is a Fly-catcher,
described by Mr. Nuttall, and the last a Thrush.
</p>

<p>
We leave tomorrow for Portland, in Maine, through which
we will merely pass, and ere one week expires, expect to be
at the Bay of Fundy.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Audubon family now traveled by carriage and
mail-coach along the entire coast of Maine, but made no
prolonged stay until they reached Eastport, where excursions
were taken into the surrounding country, and
the woods and shores were thoroughly ransacked. At
Dennisville they made the acquaintance of Judge Lincoln's
family, which rendered their stay of a number of
weeks "exceedingly agreeable"; as will appear later,<a name='FA_22' id='FA_22' href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a>
it was this agreeable family that furnished Audubon
with a valuable recruit for his expedition to Labrador.
Towards the end of September they entered New
Brunswick and began to ascend the St. John's River.
A week was passed at Fredericton, where they were
hospitably received by Sir Archibald Campbell. Thence
they continued in a small boat, which was towed upstream
by mules, to Woodstock, Maine. There a cart
was procured, in which they proceeded overland to
Houlton, in Aroostook County, then "A neat village,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
consisting of some fifty houses," and after a few days
passed at this garrison town in looking for new birds,
they started for Bangor, following the old military road
which led along the Penobscot River to Old Town. Said
the ornithologist of this journey:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Autumn, with her mellow tints, her glowing fruits, and her
rich fields of corn, smiled in placid beauty. Many of the fields
had not been reaped; the fruits of the forests and orchards
hung clustering around us, and as we came in view of the
Penebscot river, our hearts thrilled with joy....
</p>

<p>
The road which we followed from Old Town to Bangor was
literally covered with Penobscot Indians, returning from market.
On reaching the latter beautiful town, we found very
comfortable lodgings in an excellent hotel; and the next day
we proceeded by the mail to Boston.<a name='FA_23' id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon felt that he ought to remain in America
for at least another year, and decided to send his son,
Victor, to England to take charge of his publication.
This work had now become a paramount family interest,
and for the nineteen years of life that remained to the
elder Audubon, his two sons virtually became his assistants,
John as an active collector and companion in the
field, and Victor as his business agent and secretary. In
writing again to Edward Harris, from Boston, November
1, 1832, Audubon noted that they had found the
Canada Grouse in abundance, and that he was assured of
its breeding commonly within the Union; Victor, he
added, had sailed to England, "on the tenth of last
month" on the packet ship <i>South America</i>.
</p>

<p>
The autumn of 1832 and the following winter were
spent in Boston, where the naturalist was busily engaged
in drawing and in laying plans for the now famous expedition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
to the coast of Labrador. Meantime Bachman,
who was keenly interested in his success, was urging him
to return to Charleston; on October 20, 1832, he wrote:
"A month in your society would afford me greater pleasure
than the highest prize in a lottery. I cannot, I find,
feel myself at home with new birds without having the
skins to refer to. My cabinet is enlarging every day.
Henry Ward now prepares the skins—a pair of each....
What ducks, that are not likely to be obtained for
you in Boston, would you like Maria to draw for you?"
Writing again on the 26th of October, he said:<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I wish to know what you are doing—what progress your
work is making; and, whilst I feel deeply interested for your
fame ... I feel also a particular interest in your personal
welfare, and that of all that belongs to you;... Besides, I
want to see you once more to ascertain whether you have stuck
to your good resolutions, viz., never to swear (which is a vulgar
practice for one who is conversant with the most beautiful
of God's works, the feathered race), and never to work on
Sundays. However, you are now under the tutorage of your
good wife, and, I doubt not, you are as obedient to her in
these things, as you ought to be.... You say new birds are
scarce. So they are, and yet, in my opinion, we will occasionally
find them for half a century to come. (November 11)
Maria has figured for you the "White Hibiscus," and, also, a
red one, both natives and beautiful; a Euonymus in seed, in
which our Sylvia is placed; the white Nondescript Rose; the
Gordonica, a Begonia.... She is prepared to send them to
you; shall she ship them at once to Boston?... Your resolution
to publish the 3rd. Vol. of Water Birds, you will recollect
was partly entered into here, and from that moment, my
mind was at ease. It will give you four or five years in advance,
and will enable you, in a 5th. Vol., to add all recent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
discoveries of Land and Water Birds. Should you yet be
able to go to Florida and the Pacific, I apprehend that you will
extend our American Ornithology to 460 or 470 species, perhaps
more. Your sons being able to skin birds and paint them,
is a great desideratum; it should be mentioned in the preface
to your next volume. The talents of the family combined ...
will now place the work beyond the fear of falling through, even
in case of your death, and the public ought to know it. But
you must push for subscribers. If your son Victor can do
nothing in Europe, you must go there yourself, and sooner
than let the work suffer, you must go on a pilgrimage throughout
all the great cities of our Union. Should God spare your
life, I want to hear of you enjoying, in your old age "<i>Otium
cum dignitate</i>," and to see your children reaping some of your
recompense.

Under date of December 20, 1832, his friend "had
nothing to write but bad news," and hoped "to see our
political atmosphere a little brighter. Do not ask me
about birds; I do not know a Buzzard from a King Bird....
Oh, what an enjoyment it would be for me to
escape, just for one week, from the hydra-headed 'Nullification,'

While at Boston in the winter of 1833, Audubon
obtained from the proprietor of the New England Museum,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
in Court Street, a superb specimen of the Golden
Eagle, which had been caught in the White Mountains
in a trap set for foxes. Possessed with a desire to depict
this noble bird, he worked so hard at the drawing that,
as he said, it nearly cost him his life; he was suddenly
seized with "a spasmodic affection," which prostrated
him for a time and greatly alarmed his family, but
thanks to a strong constitution and to the aid of his
medical friends, Doctors Parkman, Warren and Shattuck,
the crisis was averted, and he was soon able to
continue his labors. "The drawing of this Eagle," said
the naturalist, "took me fourteen days, and I had never
before laboured so incessantly excepting at that of the
Wild Turkey." He was at work on this painting when
the following letter<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> was dispatched to his eldest son:

enough cash to establish our going to Labrador until she does.
Push Jos. B. Kidd of Edinburgh if he <i>can</i> be pushed to paint
copies of our drawings. I look on that series as of great
importance to us all. Havell's blunder in not having the numbers

New York as soon as the weather moderates, on Sunday last

In the spring of 1833 Audubon was determined to
carry out a long cherished desire to explore the coast of
Labrador, where he hoped not only to discover many
new birds, but to ascertain the summer plumages and
breeding habits of a host of water fowl that were known
to resort in the milder season to that stern and rock-bound
shore. Accordingly, he set about with characteristic
energy to organize and finance an expedition
upon his own responsibility. The number of his American
subscribers was steadily increasing, and at that moment
he felt a degree of confidence in the future of his
work to hazard almost any undertaking. In April, when
his plans were fixed, he went to New York to consult
with his wife's brother-in-law and agent, Nicholas A.
Berthoud, and to settle his business affairs before leaving
the country. While there he wrote the following long
letter<a name='FA_28' id='FA_28' href='#FN_28' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> to his son, Victor, filled, as usual, with careful
instructions and interesting personal details. It will be
noticed that when he took pen in hand the number of
his American subscribers stood at 51, but before he laid
it down it had risen to 54; his belief that his efforts in the
cause of natural science would receive a hearty response
in his own country was fully justified.

to your Dear Mother—when at Boston I will take 500 $ more
and send the Balance to N. Berthoud—he will then have about
$ 1278.91 of cash out of which he will send you 100 £ say 480 $
leaving still with him about $ 798.91, besides what he will collect
from the South the amount which is mentioned above, <i>all
of</i> which I hope will be collected ere I return to this Place, as
early as I can without losing the opportunity of doing all that
can be done.

You will easily perceive by all this that we have been extremely
fortunate of late on this Side of the Water, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
400 £ forwarded to you will fully enable you to meet the demands
of Havell &amp;<span class="sup">c</span> for the 20 Volumes you have to send here &amp;
other emergencies.—We have at Present 51 Subscribers in the
U. States, without the name of Doc<span class="sup">r</span> Croghan from whom not a
word has been heard, and also without that of <i>Baron Krudener</i>
who is now at Washington City, but who has not taken any
cognisance of the letter I sent him. N. Berthoud is going to
write to him and I hope the Baron will take the work.—he certainly
ought.

Audubon was particularly anxious to enlist a number
of enthusiastic young men in the Labrador enterprise,
and had hoped that his friend, Edward Harris, would
join the party. Upon his return to Boston he started
at once for Eastport, Maine, where he expected to charter
a vessel and complete his preparations. On May 9,
1833, he wrote to Harris from that point:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The more I approach the desired object of this voyage,
the more bouyant my spirits, and the greater my hopes that
when I return I will bring a cargo (not of codfish) but of most
valuable information. Make up your mind; shoulder your firelock,
and away to the fields where science awaits us with ample
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
stores, the contents of which are the rarest materials ever employed
by nature.
</p>
</div>

<p>
To this friend he wrote again from Eastport on the
14th of the same month:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
As to my making use of your name in my letterpress, I shall
act as you desire, and yet I hope and fully expect no denial on
your part, on such occasions as will grant me the pleasure of
giving public notice of the treatment I have received from you.
I owe such a thing to you as a trifling, very trifling, mark of my
gratitude towards one, whom I shall never cease to admire and
esteem.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>National Gazette</i> of Philadelphia for May 2,
1833, devoted an editorial to Audubon and his prospective
Labrador journey, in which the writer said: "We
wish him a degree of success and prolongation of vigor
equal to his great merits: indeed, for the past at least,
success is fully assured." He added that between fifty
and sixty subscribers to <i>The Birds of America</i> had then
been obtained in the United States; Boston had furnished
eighteen; New York, eleven; Philadelphia, four;
Baltimore, eight; Savannah, seven; Louisville, two, and
New Orleans, three; moreover, the legislatures of Massachusetts,
New York, Maryland and South Carolina
and the Congressional Library were subscribers for one
copy each. The writer continued:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A contribution to Mr. Audubon equal at least to that of
Boston or New York, would seem due from Philadelphia. The
subscription price may be considered as large ($ 1,000), but
how rich, ornamental, instructive, and entertaining is the work,
and how much preferable to the merely personal gewgaws or
transitory gratifications, upon which greater sums are as frequently
expended! There are few minds of any refinement or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
elevation, to which an act that rewards genius and fosters
science, would not yield higher and more durable pleasure than
any ordinary luxury.
</p>

<p>
We learn that Mr. Audubon will return to the United
States next autumn, and make a short sojourn before his embarkation
for Europe. Eight or nine more years, it is supposed,
will yet be necessary for the consummation of his grand
design. His constitution appears to be still vigorous; his zeal
is unabated; his powers of graphic delineation have suffered no
decay; we may, therefore, expect that he will realize all his
own laudatory hopes and projects, and in so doing confer new
obligations on the votaries of natural history, and reflect additional
honor on his country.
</p>
</div>

<p>
While Audubon was still at Eastport, and looking
anxiously for young recruits, the following letter
was received from Dr. George Parkman:<a name='FA_30' id='FA_30' href='#FN_30' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a>

<p>
Edward Harris was unable to accompany his friend,
and the four young men eventually chosen were Joseph
Coolidge,<a name='FA_31' id='FA_31' href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a> William Ingalls, of Boston, Thomas Lincoln,
of Dennisville, Maine, and George Cheyne Shattuck,<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a>
the son of Dr. George C. Shattuck of Boston;
these, with John Woodhouse Audubon and the naturalist,
made up the party. The schooner <i>Ripley</i>, a staunch
new vessel of 106 tons, was chartered at Eastport, and
the expedition was ready to start by the latter part of
May. During his stay at Eastport Audubon visited
Grand Manan Island, a favorite resort for sea birds in
the Bay of Fundy, and cruised about the coast in a
revenue cutter. On May 31, he wrote to Victor:<a name='FA_33' id='FA_33' href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have been working hard at the Birds from Grand Menan,
as well as John, who is overcoming his habit of sleeping late,
as I call him every morning at four, and we have famous long
days....
</p>

<p>
The hull of the vessel has been floored, and our great table
solidly fixed in a tolerably good light under the main hatch;
it is my intention to draw whenever possible, and that will be
many hours, for the daylight is with us nearly all the time in
those latitudes, and the fishermen say you can do with little
sleep, the air is so pure.
</p>
</div>

<p>
After repeated delays the <i>Ripley</i> sailed from Eastport
for Labrador on June 6, 1833, and the journey
proved arduous and hazardous enough. Although disappointing
in respect to the number of new species of
birds discovered, Audubon's visit was well timed; he was
aided by a band of devoted and energetic youth, and
they spent two months on the coast of a wild country,
then but little known save to a nefarious crew of egg
robbers and a few enterprising fishermen. His published
journal of the voyage shows that he worked to
the full limit of his physical powers in studying and
portraying the wonderful bird life which the party encountered.
Despite the miseries of seasickness, an incompetent
pilot, tempestuous weather, and the cramped
quarters of a small schooner, where all his drawings had
to be done under an open hatch, he accomplished wonders,
considering the shortness of his stay. By rising at
three o'clock in the morning and working for seventeen
hours, he succeeded in completing many large drawings
of birds, as well as studies of characteristic flowers; he
also journalized voluminously and saw much of the coast
and its adjacent islands.
</p>

<p>
From Eastport they passed through the Gut of
Canso and steered for the Magdalen Islands, where they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
landed and made collections. On June 14 they approached
the famous Bird Rock, which at a distance
seemed to be covered with a mantle of new-fallen snow,
an illusion soon dispelled as their vessel bore them nearer
and a vast concourse of Gannets rose in great clouds
from the rock; "all stood astonished and amazed," said
Audubon, and he felt that such a sight had of itself fully
repaid them for their journey. On June 17, the twelfth
day out from Eastport, they passed Anticosti Island,
and soon began to see what appeared like white sails on
the horizon; these proved to be snow drifts on the Labrador,
and on the 18th they landed at the mouth of the
Natashquan River. Ducks, Geese, Auks and Guillemots
were there in great multitudes, as well as Gulls
and Terns; many were breeding, and all seemed wilder
than at points farther south, a circumstance which was
explained as soon as they discovered the astounding proportions
which the traffic in eggs of sea fowl had attained
even at that time.<a name='FA_34' id='FA_34' href='#FN_34' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a>
</p>

<p>
On June 27 they procured a new bird<a name='FA_35' id='FA_35' href='#FN_35' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a> which Audubon
named after his young companion, Thomas Lincoln
of Dennisville, Maine, and which is still known as "Lincoln's
Finch." This reference is found in his journal for
the 4th of July: "I have drawn all day, and have finished
the plate of the Fringilla lincolnii, to which I have
put three plants of the country; to us they are very
fitting to the purpose, for Lincoln gathered them."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Ripley</i> left its anchorage at American Harbor
or Natashquan on June 28, and stood out to sea, their
usual recourse to avoid the intricacies of the coast. After
proceeding fifty miles or more they touched at numerous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
islands, where Guillemots, Puffins, and Black-backed
Gulls were breeding in vast numbers, and managed to
anchor safely, in spite of that "ignorant ass" of a pilot,
at a wild and desolate point which a recent traveler has
identified as the harbor of Wapitagun.<a name='FA_36' id='FA_36' href='#FN_36' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> July the second
was such a beautiful day for Labrador that Audubon
went on shore, where he drew this vivid picture of
that desolate land in sunshine:<a name='FA_37' id='FA_37' href='#FN_37' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The country, so wild and grand, is of itself enough to interest
any one in its wonderful dreariness. Its mossy, gray-clothed
rocks, heaped and thrown together as if by chance,
in the most fantastical groups imaginable, huge masses hanging
on minor ones as if about to roll themselves down from
their doubtful-looking situations, into the depths of the sea
beneath. Bays without end, sprinkled with rocky islands of
all shapes and sizes, where in every fissure a Guillemot, a
Cormorant, or some other wild bird retreats to secure its egg,
and raise its young, or save itself from the hunter's pursuit.
The peculiar cast of the sky, which never seems to be certain,
butterflies flitting over snow-banks, probing beautiful dwarf
flowerets of many hues [that are] pushing their tender stems
from the thick bed of moss which everywhere covers the granite
rocks. Then the morasses, wherein you plunge up to your
knees, or the walking over the stubborn, dwarfish shrubbery,
making one think that as he goes he treads down the <i>forests</i>
of Labrador. The unexpected Bunting, or perhaps Sylvia,
which perchance, and indeed as if by chance alone, you now
and then see flying before you, or hear singing from the creeping
plants of the ground. The beautiful fresh water lakes, on
the ragged crests of greatly elevated islands, wherein the Red
and Black-necked Divers swim as proudly as swans do in other
latitudes, and where the fish appear to have been cast as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
strayed beings from the surplus food of the ocean. All—all is
wonderfully grand, wild—aye, and terrific. And yet how beautiful
it is now, when one sees the wild bee, moving from one
flower to another in search of food, which doubtless is as sweet
to it, as the essence of the magnolia is to those of favored
Louisiana. The little Ring Plover rearing its delicate and tender
young, the Eider Duck swimming man-of-war-like amid
her floating brood, like the guardship of a most valuable convoy;
the White-crowned Bunting's sonorous note reaching the
ear ever and anon; the crowds of sea-birds in search of places
wherein to repose or to feed: how beautiful is all this in this
wonderful rocky desert at this season, the beginning of July,
compared with the horrid blasts of winter which here predominate
by the will of God, when every rock is rendered smooth
with snows so deep that every step the traveller takes is as
if entering into his grave; for even should he escape an avalanche,
his eye dreads to search the horizon, for full well does
he know that snow,—snow, is all that can be seen. I watched
the Ring Plover for some time; the parents were so intent on
saving their young that they both lay on the rocks as if shot,
quivering their wings and dragging their bodies as if quite
disabled. We left them and their young to the care of the
Creator. I would not have shot one of the old ones, or taken
one of the young for any consideration, and I was glad my
young men were as forbearing.

By dint of hard work and rising at three, I have drawn a
<i>Colymbus septemtrionalis</i> [Great Northern Diver] and a

however, at half-past five, my fingers could no longer hold my
pencil, and I was forced to abandon my work and go ashore
for exercise. The fact is that I am growing old too fast; alas!

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Drawing all day; finished the female Grouse and five young,
and prepared the male bird. The captain, John, and Lincoln,
went off this afternoon with a view to camp on a bay about
ten miles distant. Soon after, we had a change of weather,
and, for a wonder, bright lightning and something like summer
clouds. When fatigued with drawing I went on shore for exercise,
and saw many pretty flowers, amongst them a flowering
Sea-pea, quite rich in color.... The mosquitoes quite as
numerous as in Louisiana.
</p>

<p>
On July 14 the <i>Ripley</i> took the party forty-three
miles farther east to Little Maccatina, or Hare Harbor,
as it is called today, where they remained until July 21,
proceeding thence to Baie de Portage. Here they were
able to enter their small boats, and visited the captain
of a whaling schooner from New Brunswick, a Canadian
trapper, and a Scotchman, Samuel Robertson by name,
who was engaged in the sealing industry at Sparr Point,
all of whom Audubon pumped for information on the
country and its products. On July 25, they started for
"Chevalier's Settlement," but were caught in a storm,
and came to in Bras d'Or (Bradore) Bay; there they
found the Labrador Duck, which in 1875, but forty-two
years later, had become totally extinct.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of August the brief Labrador summer,
of barely one month, was drawing to a close, and
Audubon was exerting his utmost efforts to accomplish
his purposes. Under date of August 10 he wrote:<a name='FA_39' id='FA_39' href='#FN_39' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My reason for not writing at night is that I have been
drawing so constantly, often seventeen hours a day, that the
weariness of my body at night has been unprecedented, by
such work at least. At times I felt as if my physical powers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
would abandon me; my neck, my shoulders, and, more than all,
my fingers, were almost useless through actual fatigue at drawing.
Who would believe this? Yet, nothing is more true.
When at the return of dawn my spirits called me out of my
berth, my body seemed to beg my mind to suffer it to rest a
while longer; and as dark forced me to lay aside my brushes
I immediately went to rest as if I had walked sixty-five miles
that day, as I have done <i>a few times</i> in my stronger days. Yesternight,
when I rose from my little seat to contemplate my
work and to judge of the effect of it compared with the nature
which I had been attempting to copy, it was the affair of a
moment; instead of waiting, as I always like to do, until the
hazy darkness which is to me the best time to judge of the
strength of light and shade, I went at once to rest as if delivered
from the heaviest task I ever performed. The young men think
my fatigue is added to by the fact that I often work in wet
clothes, but I have done that all my life with no ill effects. No!
no! it is that I am no longer young. But I thank God that I
did accomplish my task; my drawings are finished to the best of
my ability, (and) the skins well prepared by John.

On the 11th of August all hands parted with Labrador
without regret, and the captain of the <i>Ripley</i> steered
for Newfoundland, where they landed in St. George's
Harbor on the 13th. That region was searched for five
days, when a fresh start was made for Pictou, Nova
Scotia, but when they encountered head winds, Audubon
and his party were landed on the nearest shore
and made their way overland to the town. Thence they
proceeded to Truro and Halifax, and after three days
went on to Windsor, where they watched the famous
tides in the Bay of Fundy—emptying and filling a
broad river, and rising, in course, to a height of sixty-five
feet. From that point a steamboat was taken to St.
Johns, New Brunswick, where the faithful Harris
awaited the naturalist with tidings of his wife and elder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
son;<a name='FA_40' id='FA_40' href='#FN_40' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> this intelligence induced him to abandon his contemplated
course through the woods of Quebec and
hasten back to the United States. The party finally
reached Eastport on August 31, after being out nearly
twelve weeks. When the <i>Ripley</i> had docked and their
collections were securely packed, all but Coolidge and
Lincoln returned to Boston, and on September 7 Audubon
was again in New York.
</p>

<p>
The Labrador experience was in a measure disappointing,
but the naturalist brought back twenty-three
large drawings of birds, complete or nearly so, and seventy-three
bird skins, as well as considerable collections
of marine animals and plants. The expenses of the
journey had been heavy, amounting, as he told his son,
to "about $2,000," but one fine morning when they
had flushed a Black Poll Warbler from its nest, Audubon
felt that he was amply "refunded in the sight,"
though this bird was later found to have a much wider
breeding range than he then supposed.
</p>

<p>
The <i>National Gazette</i> of Philadelphia<a name='FA_41' id='FA_41' href='#FN_41' class='fnanchor'>[41]</a> published
a long editorial upon Audubon's return, as well as an
extended account of his journey, extracted from the
<i>Boston Patriot</i>. To quote the editor's comment:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The distinguished naturalist returned from his northeastern
excursion to Boston Wednesday last. We believe that
there is no one who will not be gratified to learn the progress
of his arduous and unremitted labors in a branch of science,
which he has made peculiarly his own; and he has kindly favored
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
us with information on the subject of his recent tour,
which we are glad to lay before our readers; regretting only
that we are unable to present it in his own rich and animated
language, and to invest it with the attractions which it would
derive from his own descriptive powers.

<p>
While at Halifax Audubon received a congratulatory
letter from Bachman, who urged him to visit
Charleston and to bring his family. The invitation was
accepted, and early in September Audubon returned to
New York, where he immediately prepared the new
drawings for dispatch to London; thirteen of the land
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
birds were for the completion of his second volume,
and seventeen, representing water fowl, were to form
the initial series of the third; all, as usual, were heavily
insured.
</p>

<p>
Audubon left New York with his wife on September
25 and spent nearly a month <i>en route</i> to Charleston,
while John, who intended to accompany his father to
Florida, went direct by water. Dr. Thomas L. McKenney,
of Philadelphia, in a letter to Lewis Cass, Secretary
of War, said:<a name='FA_42' id='FA_42' href='#FN_42' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mr. Audubon makes no more of tracking it in all directions
over this, and I may add other countries, than a shot star does
in crossing the heavens. He goes after winged things, but
sometimes needs the aid of—at least a few feathers, to assist
him better to fly. He means to coast it again round Florida—make
a track through Arkansas—go up the Missouri—pass on
to the Rocky Mountains, and thence to the Pacific. He will
require some of your official aid.
</p>
</div>

<p>
As a contrast to the warmth of Audubon's greeting
in Philadelphia, while in that city he was arrested for
debt, and was on the point of being taken to jail when
he was offered bail by a friend. "This event," he said,
"brings to my mind so many disagreeable thoughts connected
with my former business transactions, in which I
was <i>always</i> the <i>single</i> loser, that I will only add I made
all necessary arrangements to have it paid."
</p>

<p>
Four new subscribers were obtained at Baltimore,
but when the naturalist applied to Secretary Cass at
Washington for the privilege of accompanying an expedition
to the Rocky Mountains under the patronage
of the Government, he met with a cool reception, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
though he had forgotten his letter from Dr. McKenney,
he was resolved not to trouble that official further.
At this juncture he met Washington Irving, who did
his best to save the situation, and thought that Audubon
had been mistaken in his judgment of the Secretary;
"I might have been," he said, "but those eyes of mine
have discovered more truth in men's eyes than their
mouths were willing to acknowledge." Irving accompanied
him to the offices of Mr. Taney, the Secretary
of the Treasury, who at once gave the naturalist the
privileges of the revenue cutter service on the southern
coast.
</p>

<p>
At Richmond Audubon met Governor Floyd, who
promised to try to induce the legislature of his State to
subscribe for a copy of the <i>Birds</i>. From that point to
Charleston we shall follow their itinerary as given in
his journal under date of October 16:<a name='FA_43' id='FA_43' href='#FN_43' class='fnanchor'>[43]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We left Richmond this morning in a stage well crammed
with Italian musicians and southern merchants, arrived at
Petersburg at a late hour, dined, and were again crammed in
a car drawn by a locomotive, which dragged us twelve miles
an hour, and sent out sparks of fire enough to keep us constantly
busy in extinguishing them on our clothes. At Blakely
we were again crammed into a stage, and dragged two miles an
hour. We crossed the Roanoke River by torchlight in a flatboat,
passed through Halifax, Raleigh, Fayetteville, and
Columbia, where we spent the night. Here I met Dr. Gibbs,
at whose house we passed the evening, and who assisted me
greatly; at his house I met President Thomas Cooper, who
assured me he had seen a rattlesnake climb a five-rail fence on
his land. I received from the treasury of the State four hundred
and fifty dollars on account of its subscription for one
copy of the "Birds of America."
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
</p>

<p class="post">
For a number of years Audubon's snake stories had
subjected him to no little ridicule in certain quarters,
and this notice of a climbing rattlesnake pleased him
so much that he asked the venerable president to put
his statement in writing; he willingly complied, and his
interesting letter on the subject will be given in a later
chapter.<a name='FA_44' id='FA_44' href='#FN_44' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a>
</p>

<p>
When Audubon and his wife reached the Bachman
home on October 24, he was prepared to push on to the
South, but changed his plans, on account, he said, "of
the removal of my good friend Captain Robert Day
from his former station to New York, and I did not
like to launch on the Florida reefs in the care of a young
officer unknown to me." The winter of 1833-4 was
passed under the hospitable rooftree of his friend, in the
usual occupations of painting, writing and hunting
birds. At this time an attachment sprang up between
his younger son, John Woodhouse Audubon, and Maria
Rebecca, the eldest daughter of the Bachman household.
Here Audubon wrote the first drafts of many of the
bird biographies contained in the second volume of his
letterpress, and with Bachman conducted a series of
careful experiments on the power of smell in vultures,
in order to settle a question which had then become acute
among naturalists.<a name='FA_45' id='FA_45' href='#FN_45' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a> This subject is referred to in the
following intimate letter,<a name='FA_46' id='FA_46' href='#FN_46' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a> which reveals the confidence
which Audubon felt in his sons and in their united ability
to bring his great undertaking to a successful issue,
as well as the infinite pains which he bestowed upon
every part of it. Audubon, who was now in his forty-ninth
year, felt that he was aging very fast, and declared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
that one year then would be equal to three, three
years from that time.

</p>

<p>
Your last letter to us is dated at London, 7th. Octbr. It
has given us all ample and sincere pleasure. The copy of your
reply<a name='FA_47' id='FA_47' href='#FN_47' class='fnanchor'>[47]</a> to Mons. Waterton is excellent; that from Swainson
ought to prove a death-blow to the Demerara Gent! I hope
that these letters are now before the world, for my mortification
has been great enough respecting the blackguardism of
G. Ord and others, and yet I am heartily glad that I never paid
personally any attention to them through the press or otherwise.
Here my friends are as much shocked as myself, and
the moment is at hand when these T... will be glad to find some
hiding place to resort to, and wait for time to obliterate their
obvious jealousy and falsehood.
</p>

<p>
John Bachman and myself have begun a second series of
experiments, such as I made before, connected with the nose-smelling
of Turkey Buzzards; as far as we have gone through
them, these experiments have proved <i>perfectly</i> satisfactory to
my good friend and myself, and depend [upon] it, from next
Wednesday, the American World will know that Turkey Buzzards
are first, Gregarious, as well as the Carrion Crow [Black
Vulture], that they eat fresh meat in preference to putrid
stuff; that they eat birds, fresh killed, either plucked or not,
<i>even of their own species</i>; that they suck birds' eggs, and devour
their callow young; that they come to their food by
their sense of sight, and not that of smell, and lastly that
they cannot discover by any sense of smell the most putrid
matter, even when this putrid stuff is within a few feet of them,
out of sight of their eyes. Were Snakes as abundant near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
Charleston as Buzzards, that business would soon be also set
at rest, but for this, however, time is required, and the time
I think will come. The experiments we are making will be
repeated in the presence of the faculty of this city,<a name='FA_48' id='FA_48' href='#FN_48' class='fnanchor'>[48]</a> and their
Certificates attached to the whole, and immediately published
in the Annals of the Philosophical Society of Phila.<a name='FA_49' id='FA_49' href='#FN_49' class='fnanchor'>[49]</a> those
of the Lyceum of New York. A copy will be sent to be read at
the Linnean, or Royal Society of London, and Royal Institute
of France; then let those laugh who win. We have attracted
Turkey Buzzards with pieces of fresh beef, not more
than an inch square, and we have seen others pass unnoticed
the body of a hare or fowl within 20 steps. We have now 3 fine
birds of this species to experiment upon, and their olfactory
nerves will be examined by the faculty here, where there are
some highly talented men.
</p>

<p>
Our friend Bachman has written a very fine paper for
Loudon's Mag.<a name='FA_50' id='FA_50' href='#FN_50' class='fnanchor'>[50]</a> which will be forwarded to you in a few days
by duplicate, and which I wish you to give to our friend J. G.
Children, and ask him to have it read at the R. and L. Societies,
and inserted in the above mentioned Mag. afterwards.
We hope all this will be accomplished by the 1st. March next.
</p>

<p>
Now to other subjects. We are deeply at work. John has
drawn a few Birds, as good as any I ever made, and in a few
months I hope to give this department of my duty up to him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
altogether; his improvements on other subjects are equally
pleasing. I write a [biography of a] Bird or so every evening,
and our friend grants me all his knowledge of the habits of
those with which he has become well acquainted, belonging to
this part of the Union. I have nearly <i>one 100</i> drawings of
Water Birds ready for publication &amp; I pronounce them equal
to any previous ones. I am much pleased at the news you give
me respecting Havell; I hope he will continue with hand and
heart to do all in his power for the fame of our work, and for
himself. We have not seen Nos. 34, 35, tho. from your letter
we suppose them to be in New York. Wm. Oakes, I have written
you, has paid all, up to No. 33; Arnold, of New Bedford,
for all he has had; John Neal has his copy, but I do not know
if he has yet paid Dr. Parkman, who is our kind friend and
agent in that part of the Country. I wish you had forwarded
<i>first volumes</i> bound, as you had those on hand, as several would
have been disposed of and paid for by this time; do send all,
or whatever of them you have ready, as <i>soon as possible</i>. It
will be well for you to have friend Bachm's. paper published
in <i>toto</i>, in some <i>good circulating paper</i> in London &amp; Edinboro.
Brushes! Brushes! Brushes! I am glad to hear of Kidd &amp; Co.'s
publication of Parrots, but I regret that my face should have
been there from Syme's picture, which in my estimation is none
of the best. Push Kidd with the pictures; <i>have them, and take
care of them</i>. Sell all the Shells you please; write to John
Adamson, of New Castle, about them, but keep smug all the
Bird Skins. I cannot do without them when I write my Synopsis,
which will be when I am with you. Our voyage round the
Floridas, Gulph Mexico &amp;c. will begin about the 1st. February.
This will be my last journey, after which John and I will hunt
for Subscribers, procure a round number, and join you as soon
as possible. Your dear Mama will in all probability join you
in May or June next. In about a fortnight I shall send you
more land Birds for the end of the 2d. volume, extra small
plates, and several <i>numbers</i> of <i>Water</i> Birds. I am anxious to
hear something about the little edition. Do not omit to let me
know when you want money, for tho. our expenses are always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
great, <i>the Work</i> must not, and shall not suffer, as long as my
eyes and hands can work.
</p>

<p>
Dec. 23d., last evening, we had the pleasure of yours of
the 28 Oct, and one from Havell of the 9th. Regarding Havell,
we are glad that all is well with him, and hope he will not
trouble us about extra prices, not even for the <i>Water Birds</i>.
The safe arrival of my last drawings has relieved me of that
anxiety. You are quite right on the score of <i>advice</i>. <i>You</i> in
England, will do best to act as you may think proper. <i>We</i>,
in America, are trying to do equally well, and our little
<i>Alliance</i> is as efficient as the Holy one at least. That Subscribers
should die is an event we cannot help; that such fellows
as V. should act so cannot be controlled, but depend upon
our <i>industry</i>, our <i>truth</i>, and the regular manner in which we
publish our work; this will always prove to the world and to
our Patrons that nothing more can be done than what we do;
nay, I doubt if any <i>family</i>, with our pecuniary means, ever
will raise for themselves such a monument as the "Birds of
America" is, over their tomb.

How comes it that Harlan has not money enough to pay
his expenses in Europe? I shall remember the 20 £, and the
exchange. Chamley, of New Castle, was never prompt pay;
indeed, my dear Victor, were you fully acquainted with the
great difficulties which I had to surmount and did surmount,
it would give you less fear than you now feel or experience.
We shall be glad to receive the Brushes that are, I hope, now
under way for us. Mr. Miesson resides [at] No. 2 Rue
Pigalle, on the east side of the grand Boulevards. Present my
regards to Mr. Yarrell, and thank him in my name for his kind
offer of eggs, and add that I shall have it in my power to
present him with many which I think he has not found, that
our two collections will most likely comprise the whole of those
published in my 4 volumes. I fear that to give the eggs in
the 2d. of Biography would render that volume too large,
and again too costly, and that a few plates of eggs at the end
of the large work will answer better.<a name='FA_51' id='FA_51' href='#FN_51' class='fnanchor'>[51]</a> The <i>plates</i> ought to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
be insured for at least 4 or 5 times the cost, for should they by
an accident be destroyed, the amount of their cost would prove
a poor remuneration, when compared with the time it would
require to have them renewed. Attend to this as soon as you
can. Henry Ward has rendered himself very obnoxious <i>here</i>.
a letter came to Mr. B. on last evening from St. Augustine, to
inquire how a certain amount left by him unpaid was to be settled.
Mr. Bachman will inform you of the particulars.
</p>

<p>
Do forward the bound volumes as soon as possible, for with
them I could at once make you a considerable remittance,
which would enable you to prepare the Nos. of the 2d. Vol. for
those who do not wish to have it complete. I am trying to
receive some money on Act. of the 2d. Vol. through the mediums
of Dr. Parkman, N. Berthoud, John Bellonis, Wm. Gaston,
and will let you know the result. The Plate ... which
you sent me is <i>extremely well</i> engraved, but let us keep to
Havell as long as he behaves with propriety, and does good
work.
</p>

<p>
I have now replied to your letter fully, except on what you
say about my immediate <i>return</i>. The following are my views,
but if after all, you say—come on, <i>I shall do so</i>. Our country
is becoming more wealthy every day. Science is looked upon
with more congeniality every year. Subscribers in this Dear
Country of ours do not drop off unless they die. They pay
punctually on demand, and to have more of them in this land
than in Europe is a thing that may prove of the greatest
importance <i>to us</i>. When I visited our woods on my first return
from England, I was absent about 12 months. The Rathbones
and Mr. Children wrote to me many times to return, or
expect the work to fall. I went back to Europe before I was
ready to go, and on my arrival there, to my surprise and joy,
I found everything going on as well as usual; but I was again
obliged to come to our Country to renew my researches, and
improve my head, as well as my collection of drawings. I had
then left no one like you in England. Now you, my Dear Son,
are there; thank God for it! You prove to be a better man
at carrying on the publication than myself, and to tell you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
more, I doubt if I could procure more subscribers there than
yourself. I am truly desirous for your sake, and that of your
dear Mother and Brother, to do all in my power for the completion
of this great work. I wish to finish here all that is to be
done both in the way of drawing, and increase of knowledge, in
<i>black and white</i>, and also in Patrons, as much as possible, ere
I return to Europe, where, when I do go, I must remain several
years, if not until the completion of the engraving. I am
growing old very fast; in 3 or 4 years my career as a traveller
will be ended, and should I be obliged to renew my field-labours,
it is doubtful if my constitution could bear it. One
year now is equal to 3, 3 years hence. I receive much assistance
from the Government, and have John to accompany me.
I am still able to undergo some fatigue, and, as I have said, I
am anxious, <i>very anxious</i>, to do all that can be done ere I
return to Europe. Now the whole time which I conceive necessary
to enable me to perform these desideratums cannot exceed
12 or 15 months. What pleasure it would be to us all,
when I take your hand and press you to my heart, I should
also have a list of <i>100 new names from America!</i>; all the drawings
and the manuscripts ready for the completion of this our
wonderful undertaking. I would advise you to address a circular
letter to all those who may be concerned in Europe, to
acquaint them with what <i>I call</i> the necessity of my being in
America, for the <i>sole purpose</i> of increasing the value of our
publications, either Illustrative or graphical. This, and the
constant improvement now exhibited to them with each new
number of the work, could not fail, I think, to render them
quiet, if not pleased, that I am now doing all I can for the
advantage of the work. Tell them the facts, that I have greatly
added to the Ornithology of the United States since my absence
from Europe, that the number of species which I now have,
and that are not given by Wilson or Bonaparte, combined,
amounts to nearly one hundred, and that the Water Birds will
be fully equal in point of interest and beauty, to any of the
land Birds that are published. And, not the least part of this,
my remaining in America has already [given], and will continue,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
to give me the power of portraying the habits of the
Water Birds with more truth and completeness than has ever
yet been done. Next, have extracts of my letter to you, before
the world's eye, through the medium of Papers. Visit
such of our friends, and ask them to say those things to their
acquaintance; go on yourself, as you have done, and depend
upon it, we shall all be <i>greatly benefitted</i>. In your most kind
letter to John you mention with unexampled modesty what you
are attempting to do in the way of self-improvement, but my
Dear Victor, you cannot convey more thoroughly to us the
<i>march</i> of your improvement than you have done by sending
your letters, and the result of your actions, so well delineated
as this is, and <i>we all</i> feel deeply gratified and most happy.
Cruickshank is <i>right</i>; by <i>drawing</i> you are enabled to study the
lights and shadows of bodies, again the beautiful mellowness
with which, altho. all powerful in <i>the effect</i>, these blend themselves
with each other. The <i>reflective power of bodies</i> will
also strike your discerning attention, and when these combinations
of the true Materia are well understood, the artist
is a Master! Nature after all, has done all for us; she groups,
and most beautifully, every thing that is presented to our eye
or mind, so completely also, that if one observes a number of
bodies, no matter what these bodies are, whether horses or apes,
he sees at once the general elegance of their arrangement in
<i>contour</i>, the force of the light and shadows, the mellowness
existing between these, and as the eye passes on to the finishing
of that natural picture, it at once pronounces it complete.
</p>

<p>
Do not forget to take from Kidd whatever pictures of ours
he may have finished, and take good care of them. We have
pretty nearly kilt G. Ord and Waterton with our Buzzard
experiments. You say you wish you could see us at friend
Bachman's; I assure you my pleasure at such an event would be
equal to yours. We are indeed happy in having such a friend.
Miss Martin, with her superior talents, assists us greatly in
the way of drawing; the insects she has drawn are, perhaps,
the best I've seen; at night we have some music and reading.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
When you receive Bird Skins, perhaps it would be as well to
form a collection of each species in pairs, and variety of age
or color.
</p>

<p>
24 Dec. We have just received yours of 18th. October.
You are, my Dear Son, too low spirited respecting my immediate
appearance in England. Cheer up, my beloved Victor!
Believe me, when I repeat that our own Dear Country will
support the efforts of us all, and will grant us more Patrons
than the whole of Europe together; by the way of a nightcap,
let me give you the name of Wm. J. Rees, of Sumpter district,
Statesbury, South Carolina, who put his name to my list this
afternoon at the moment when the Vultures lost their olfactory
powers, for I daubed the imitation of a sheep, and the very
first one that passed over the picture rounded and came to it.
</p>

<p>
Respecting Kidd, and his prospectus, depend upon it, nothing
is to be feared from that quarter; that work is <i>dead at the
moment I write</i>, and as to his publishing the intention of the
pictures, it signifies nothing. All you have to do is to <i>take all</i>
the pictures from him, <i>by goodwill or otherwise</i>, and <i>give him
no more originals to copy</i>.
</p>

<p>
If I regret anything at this moment, it is that you should
have kept the 20 volumes in London, when, if I had them in
America, I should at once be enabled to make you a valuable
remittance. Ship them, ensured, as fast as possible, and doubt
not my disposing of them. Lewis Atterbury writes me to night
that all the numbers 34, 35, which Havell has shipped, are
injured greatly by salt water. I do not know yet if they were
insured or not. I write to him this evening. Do not ship
anything without insurance; it is better to lose time in this

<p>
Honest John Bachman, who had lived and worked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
with Audubon for months at a time, and who probably
knew him better than did any one in America outside of
the naturalist's own family, gave this account of his
habits in 1834, when, at the age of forty-nine, he was
still working at his best:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
He rises at the earliest dawn, and devotes the whole of
the day, in intense industry, to his favourite pursuit. The
specimens from which he makes his drawings are all from
nature; carefully noting the colors of the eye, bill, and legs;
measuring, with great accuracy, every part of the bird. When
differences exist, either in the sexes or young, several figures
are given on the same plate; sparing no labour in retouching
old drawings or in making new ones, in all cases where he
conceives there may be a possibility of making an improvement.
In this way, he has already succeeded in figuring nearly
the whole of the birds necessary to complete his splendid and
important work.
</p>

<p>
He keeps a journal, and regularly notes down every thing
connected with natural history. This journal is always kept
in English: a language which, it must be acknowledged he
writes very correctly, when it is taken into consideration that
he spent nearly the first seventeen years of his life in France.
Besides this, he keeps separate journals, in which he notes
every thing that he learns each day on the habits of every bird.
In all his travels, he carries these journals with him; and he
never suffers business, fatigue, or pleasure to prevent him each
evening from noting down every interesting observation. In
this way, a mass of information has been accumulated from
year to year. When he sits down to write the history of a
bird (which is usually in the evening), he first reads over all
the memoranda which he has made with regard to its habits
and he is generally able to write an interesting paper on the
subject in the course of an evening. At some leisure moment
this is again revised and corrected: the scientific details he
leaves to the last.

<p>
Early in March, 1834, Audubon left his friends in
Charleston, and with his wife and son passed northward
to Washington and Baltimore. From the latter city,
on March 9, he wrote to Edward Harris, in part as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Friends such as you <i>have been</i>, and <i>are</i> still, are the only
recompense such poor individuals such as I am can enjoy in
this world, and the more valued as they are so very rare.
</p>

<p>
We came from Charleston by land to Norfolk; thence to
Washington City by steamer in 20 hours, and in 8 to the city
here, well fatigued but safely.... At Washington, where we
remained only an hour, Col. J. Abert told me something connected
with the climbing of Rattlesnakes upon trees &amp;c. that
will make your mouth water, and your generous heart leap with
joy, <i>when you read</i> [about] them, which you shall do ere long,
I give you my word for it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon was still in Baltimore on March 15, for on
that day he gave Harris a letter of introduction to
Edward Everett. New York was reached in April,
when he wrote to Bachman that they had secured berths
in "that fine packet ship the <i>North America</i>," which was
to sail on the tenth of that month.

<p>
Toward the close of Audubon's Charleston visit he
had an unpleasant experience; he was sued for an old
debt, which no doubt dated from his Henderson period
and the failure of his mill in 1819.<a name='FA_52' id='FA_52' href='#FN_52' class='fnanchor'>[52]</a> Apparently the
case was carried into court, where the naturalist was defended
by a lawyer named Dunkin, who, if my inference
is correct, later became a distinguished judge
and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court<a name='FA_53' id='FA_53' href='#FN_53' class='fnanchor'>[53]</a> of South
Carolina. The incident was referred to by Audubon
in letters written from New York at this time; on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
April 6, he wrote to Miss Maria Martin as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I told friend Bach. in my letter of yesterday that I knew
nothing of Mr. Pettigrue, connected with my business at
Charleston, and that if that gentleman had presented himself
before the court, it must have been for charity's sake; indeed,
from the conversations that passed between Friend B. &amp; I respecting
Mr. Dunker [Dunkin], it would have been absurd in
me to think for a moment of employing any other person
than Mr. D.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the letter just quoted Audubon said also that
he had spent all of the morning of the previous day
in going from shop to shop with friend Harris to procure
some models for "the dear girls," but in vain; New
York with its two hundred and fifty thousand souls,
possessed but two drawing masters; "these instruct in
<i>3 months</i>," he added, "and starve for the nine of the
year." In reference to financial matters, he said that
he had managed to collect about £600 sterling, and had
sent 500 to Victor in bills of exchange, so that when they
reached London, they would be tolerably well off, considering
that they were "naturalists from the wilds of
America." "Nothing starts the blues so effectually," he
continued, as "constant unemployment; for myself who
have done next to nothing since I left you, have had
horrors all around me; dreams of sinking and burning
ships at night, fears of lost drawings, &amp; failures of subscribers
by day, have ever and anon been my companions."
"Victor," he added, "has sent 6 boxes of pills,
which will be divided into 3 parts, the largest for G.
Ord."
</p>

<p>
The Audubons finally sailed from New York on
April 16, 1834. On the preceding day the naturalist
sent his friend, Edward Harris, a parting letter, in
which he said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
To tell you that I am surprised at your generous conduct
in remitting to me Four hundred, Ninety dollars in advance,
for all the numbers of my book, would be a poor gratification
to me. I feel your generosity, and I cannot say any more.
God bless you.
</p>

<p>
Nos. 36 &amp; 37 have reached this place; my drawings shipped
from Charleston are safely in the hands of Victor at London.
I have been able to forward him 650 £, and I have 30 sovereigns
to defray our expenses from Liverpool to the Great Metropolis.
In 1824, poor J. had dreams, but how far was I then from believing
that I should ever have succeeded as I have; who will
believe my story? Only one or two besides yourself, have
<i>an Idea</i> of what I have undergone, but, if God grants me life,
I shall publish that story, and send you the sheets thereof, as
they are struck by the printer.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon took with him to England all the collections
which he had accumulated during nearly three
years of travel and search in different parts of the
United States and the British possessions. During this
eventful period he had renewed one hundred of his
older drawings, executed many new ones, discovered new
birds, extended his acquaintance, and added sixty-two
names to his list of patrons.
</p>

<p>
After they had reached Liverpool, he wrote to Bachman,
May 8, 1834, that they had returned on the "superb
packet of 650 tons, called the <i>North America</i>, commanded
by an admirable gentleman, named Dixie of
Philadelphia"; the voyage was made in not quite twenty
days. A little later they joined their son, Victor, in
London.

<p>
We have seen that John James Audubon had attended
the school of adversity many years before he was
known to the public in either America or Europe. The
difficulties inseparable from such colossal undertakings
as that in which he engaged were well nigh insuperable;
but to these were added others which perhaps might
have been avoided but which could hardly have been
foreseen. From the moment he began to write for publication,
he was bitterly and persistently assailed by a
number of detractors, who seemed bent upon ruining
his reputation and thus undermining the work to which
he was devoting his life and upon which he depended
as a means of support.
</p>

<p>
Were no worthy purpose to be served, it would be
folly to resurrect the animosities of a past generation,
but since a few "fed fat the ancient grudge they bore
him," and since this hostility, handed down through the
years, is occasionally echoed at the present day, the impartial
historian is left no choice; he must weigh the
merits of the case to the best of his ability. The reader,
I think, will find that the law of compensation has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
worked fairly well in respect to all these matters, for
if Audubon possessed faults, he was not lacking in merits;
if he was assailed by a few bitter enemies, he was
supported by a host of judicious friends.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Audubon became known in England, he
was importuned to contribute to the scientific magazines,
and in response to this demand wrote five articles,
which were published in Edinburgh and London in 1827.
Some of these papers, which dealt with the habits of the
Turkey Vulture, the Alligator, the Carrion Crow or
Black Vulture, the Wild Pigeon, and the Rattlesnake,<a name='FA_54' id='FA_54' href='#FN_54' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a>
were roundly scored in the Philadelphia press, and Audubon
was called a romancer of the first order. Thomas
Sully, the artist, who was then living in that city and
who had taken a deep interest in the naturalist since their
meeting in 1824, wrote in November, 1827, and told him
what had occurred. Since Audubon's reply was practically
the only answer which he ever made to attacks of
this sort, and since his friend was given permission to
make such use of it as he saw fit, we shall reproduce
this letter nearly entire.<a name='FA_55' id='FA_55' href='#FN_55' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a> In writing to his wife on the
same day Audubon said: "Now my Lucy, I am going
to answer Sully's letter; it is no difficult task, so far as
truth be connected with my answer, but as regards my
feelings it is perhaps the severest one I have had to
encounter for many years."

<h4>
<i>Audubon to Thomas Sully</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letter_head">
<span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>, <i>Dec<span class="sup">r</span> 22, 1837</i>.
</p>
<p class="post">
<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Sully</span>:—
</p>

<p>
I received from your truly friendly letter of the 7th. of
November the long wished for intelligence that you and your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
family were well. I am not much astonished that in Philadelphia,
remarks such as you allude to, should have been made
respecting some papers on the habits of objects of Natural
History, read by me to different institutions in this country,
but I am grieved at it.
</p>

<p>
The greatest portion of my life has been devotedly spent
in the <i>active</i> investigation of Nature, her beauties &amp; her
objects in granting to different individuals, classes, or species,
such privileges as best suit their form, situation, or habits.
This arduous task I have followed with unremitting diligence,
and with a degree of industry that has caused to my family
and to myself more troubles than any person in Philadelphia
can be aware of. For more than 20 years I have been in <i>the
regular habit</i> of writing down every day all the incidents of
which I have been an <i>eye-witness</i>, on the spot, &amp; without confiding
to my memory, as many travellers have done and still
do. You have read some portion of this journal, and have also
been an eye-witness of many of the occurrences, and to this I
now owe the gratification of possessing your esteem, but, My
dear Mr. Sully, you are not the only evidence. Mr. Joseph
Mason, who is now, I believe, an artist in your city, accompanied
me on a hunting excursion, beginning at Cincinati, and
ending in the State of Louisiana, which lasted 18 months. He
drew with me; he was my <i>daily companion</i>, and we both rolled
ourselves together on bufaloe robes at night. James Cummings,
Esq., past captain, the author of a treatise on the
navigation of the rivers Ohio and Mississippi, was one of the
party, and he saw me write in my Journal, and read it frequently.
Every member of my family has seen the whole of those
Diaries and could readily assert the truth of the whole of their
contents, to many of which they were party, present and acting.
</p>

<p>
The papers alluded to in your estimable letter, are merely
copies from those journals; they were transcribed in Edinburgh,
and the style corrected by patrons, who saw the originals,
nearly worn out by time and the casual dampness, which
journals like mine must often be exposed to. I read these
papers to the different societies, of which I have the honor to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
be a member, and read them with a sensation of pleasure that
nothing but a full persuasion of their truth could bestow.
</p>

<p>
Those persons in Philadelphia that have felt a desire to
contradict my assertions cannot, without lowering themselves
very much indeed affect to conceive that the members of the
Wernerian Society would have listened to my "say so," without
investigating the subject, even if they had not been well versed
in the habits of the objects I treated of. Neither can they
believe that all my acquaintance and particular friends would
permit me to proceed in relating <i>Tales of Wonder</i>, which if
untrue, would load me with disgrace, ruin my family, nay,
prove me devoid of all honor! Could I suffer myself to be so
blinded at the very moment when I am engaged in the publication
of a work of unparalled magnitude, of which the <i>greatest
naturalists and best judges</i> both in America and in Europe have
given the fullest praise and firmest support, &amp; from which my
very means of pecuniary comfort are to be drawn? It would
certainly be highly unfair to conceive &amp; assert that at the time
whilst I was portraying individuals, animal and vegetable, I
should have rambled so wide and so far from facts in a portion
of science so intimately connected with &amp; necessary to the support
of those delineations, as well as to the general standing of
my reputation! Mere interest would suggest a very contrary
line of conduct, and I hope I am not so devoid of common
sense as to lose sight of all that can render life desirable in
this world or the world hereafter.
</p>

<p>
No, my dear Mr. Sully, I have written with care what I
have seen, and have felt a great desire to spread the knowledge
I have obtained in the great field of Science for the benefit of
the world at large, and I rest content with this motto: "Le
temps découvrira la vérité." To whom then, my dear Mr.
Sully, can I ascribe the birth of the animadversions expressed
in the papers of Philadelphia! Is their author one [who]
comes avowedly forward with a life spent in the woods, loaded
with facts differing in every respect from mine, one who like
me can bring forth vouchers, and who can by respectable witnesses
support what he says? Or, is he one, who, writing at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
random and without any knowledge of his subject, merely
wishes to push himself into notice by a blunt denial of my
veracity, and would <i>edify</i> &amp; <i>please</i> some of his friends, at the
price of my reputation. I think, my dear Mr. Sully, the latter
much more applicable, and must belong to the author of the
report current in your city.
</p>

<p>
I have not read any of the Philadelphia papers since I came
to England, and do not know the tone of the attacks upon me,
but judging from your friendly letter, I feel assured that the
pen that traced them must have been dipped in venom more
noxious than that which flows from the jaws of the rattlesnake!
</p>

<p>
To you, my dear Friend, I solemly affirm that however
unnatural my observations may <i>appear</i>, they are all <i>facts</i>,
without a word of exaggeration. My fate in this instance
differs not from that of many others, but believe me, will differ
widely from that of the illustrious Bruce; those attacks will
not make me die of sorrow!
</p>

<p>
With this, my dear Friend, I will close the subject, giving
you meanwhile full liberty to use this letter in any manner
that may best suit your feelings, and I will now pass on to other
things.
</p>

<p>
My success in the mother country continues to augment
apace. I have many most valuable friends and patrons, and
discovered soon after my landing that Science has no particular
country. The 5th. number of my work is now published,
&amp; completes my labor for 1827. During my progress
I have often received letters from highly distinguished characters,
expressive of the highest approbation, &amp; I hope by
regular industry to be able to go on with the performance,
with credit to myself &amp; benefit to my family.
</p>

<p>
I shall leave this town for London in a few days, when I
will convey your wishes to Robert Sully, &amp; [when] there I hope
to see the picture which you have sent to the Marquis of
Wellesley....
</p>
</div>

<p>
The attack referred to in the letter just quoted was
called forth by Audubon's unfortunate paper on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
Rattlesnake,<a name='FA_56' id='FA_56' href='#FN_56' class='fnanchor'>[56]</a> which was read before the Wernerian Society
of Edinburgh in the winter of 1827 and published
by Robert Jameson in the <i>New Philosophical Journal</i>
in April of that year. The controversy then started
was long and bitter, while the merits of neither side
were ever fully established; in the history which follows
we shall see that the naturalist was, on the whole, more
sinned against than sinning.
</p>

<p>
In July, 1828, Dr. Thomas P. Jones<a name='FA_57' id='FA_57' href='#FN_57' class='fnanchor'>[57]</a> appropriated
Audubon's Rattlesnake article, and published it without
acknowledgment in the <i>Franklin Journal and American
Mechanics' Magazine</i> at Philadelphia. It should be noticed
that at the close of 1827 Audubon's famous plate
of the Mocking Birds defending their nest against the
sinister designs of this formidable reptile had also been
published in London. In this remarkable picture the
rattlesnake was represented coiled about the nest, at the
fatal moment when ready to strike its bold defenders,
and in a tree. The anomaly was apparent, for the climbing
habits of rattlesnakes were not then generally understood.
This circumstance, together with some of Audubon's
notes, repeated in certain cases from stories current
in rural communities, furnished his detractors with
a powerful lever, which they seized with avidity; snakes
coiled in trees seemed suddenly to have produced a brood
of another order which lurked in the grass, and it was
many years before Audubon heard the last of his snake
stories. The attack in the American press was laid to
the door of George Ord, and it was not long before it
was renewed with great vigor by his friend and correspondent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
in England, Charles Waterton, who proclaimed
Audubon as a new and greater Münchhausen.<a name='FA_58' id='FA_58' href='#FN_58' class='fnanchor'>[58]</a>

<p>
Dr. Jones immediately repudiated the article which
he had unceremoniously appropriated, and under the
title of "The Romance of the Rattlesnake" inserted the
following notice in the August number of his magazine:<a name='FA_59' id='FA_59' href='#FN_59' class='fnanchor'>[59]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Just as the Editor was leaving Philadelphia for Washington,
he was pressed for "more copy" by his printer, and hastily
marked some articles for insertion, among which were
"Notes on the Rattlesnake," by John James Audubon, F.R.S.E.,
M.W.S., &amp;c. Time did not admit of reading the article,
but it was seen that the writer professed to offer the "fruits
of many years' observation, in countries where snakes abound."
This with his titles, and the bold and splendid assurances which
we had seen respecting the publication of his works, served as
a password to his tissues of falsehoods, which would have been
expunged from the proof, but for absence from the press.
</p>

<p>
We had determined to publish a notice like the foregoing,
when we received a note from a scientific friend, whose remarks
are, at once, so pointed and correct, and so fully express
our own ideas upon the subject, that we gladly adopt
and insert them.
</p>

<p>
It is a tissue of the grossest falsehoods ever attempted to
be palmed upon the credulity of mankind, and it is a pity that
any thing like countenance should be given to it, by reproducing
it in a respectable Journal. The romances of Audubon
rival those of Münchausen, Mandeville, or even Mendez de
Pinto, in the total want of truth, however short they may fall
of them in the amusement they afford.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This was rather a stiff charge to be made flatly
against the reputation of any one without the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
careful investigation, even upon the authority of "a
scientific friend." Let us see, then, what basis, if any,
really existed for such sweeping charges. In the paper
which caused the trouble Audubon had described in
great detail how he had seen a large rattlesnake pursue,
capture, kill by constriction, and devour a gray squirrel.
Before quoting his description of this singular encounter,
we shall recall a passage which Audubon wrote in his
journal at the time when it occurred,<a name='FA_60' id='FA_60' href='#FN_60' class='fnanchor'>[60]</a> when he was at
"Oakley," the plantation of James Pirrie at St. Francisville,
Bayou Sara, in the summer of 1821: "August
25. Finished drawing a very fine specimen of a rattlesnake,
which measured five feet and seven inches,
weighed six and a quarter pounds, and had ten rattles.
Anxious to give it a position most interesting to a
naturalist, I put it in that which the reptile commonly
takes when on the point of striking madly with its
fangs." After describing a rough dissection which he
made of the rattlesnake's dental arsenal and poison apparatus,
he added: "The heat of the weather was such
that I could devote only sixteen hours to the drawing."
The drawing thus referred to was undoubtedly used in
the composition of his celebrated plate.
</p>

<p>
To revert now to a mooted passage in Audubon's
published paper:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Rattlesnakes hunt and secure for their prey, with ease,
grey squirrels that abound in our woods; therefore they must
be possessed of swiftness to obtain them. Having enjoyed the
pleasure of beholding such a chase in full view in the year
1821, I shall detail its circumstances. Whilst lying on the
ground to watch the habits of a bird that was new to me, previous
to shooting it, I heard a smart rustling not far from me,
and turning my head that way, saw, at the same moment, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
grey squirrel full grown, issuing from a thicket, and bouncing
off in a straight direction, in leaps of several feet at a time,
and, not more than twenty feet behind, a rattlesnake of ordinary
size, pursuing, drawn apparently out to its full length,
and sliding over the ground so rapidly that, as they both moved
away from me, I was at no loss to observe the snake gain upon
the squirrel. The squirrel made for a tree, and ascended to
its topmost branches as nimbly as squirrels are known to do.
The snake performed the same task considerably more slowly,
yet so fast that the squirrel never raised its tail nor barked,
but eyed the enemy attentively as he mounted and approached.
When within a few yards the squirrel leaped to another branch,
and the snake followed by stretching full two-thirds of its body,
whilst the remainder held it securely from falling. Passing
thus from branch to branch, with a rapidity that astonished
me, the squirrel went in and out of several holes, but remained
in none, knowing well that, wherever its head could enter, the
body of its antagonist would follow; and, at last, much exhausted
and terrified, took a desperate leap, and came to the
earth with legs and tail spread to the utmost to ease the fall.
That instant the snake dropt also, and was within a few yards
of the squirrel before it began making off. The chase on land
again took place, and ere the squirrel could reach another
tree, the snake had seized it by the back near the occiput,
and soon rolled itself about it in such a way that, although I
heard the cries of the victim, I scarcely saw any portion of its
body. So full of its ultimate object was the snake, that it paid
no attention to me, and I approached it to see in what manner
it would dispose of its prey. A few minutes elapsed, and I
saw the reptile loosening gradually and opening its folded
coils, until the squirrel was left entirely disengaged, having
been killed by suffocation. The snake then raised a few inches
of its body from the ground, and passed its head over the dead
animal in various ways to assure itself that life had departed;
it then took the end of the squirrel's tail, swallowed it gradually,
bringing first one and then the other of the hind legs
parallel with it, and sucked with difficulty, and for some time,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
at them and the rump of the animal, until its jaws became so
expanded, that, after this, it swallowed the whole remaining
parts with apparent ease.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon then described the appearance that the
snake presently assumed, which suggested "a rouleau
of money, brought from both ends of a purse towards
its centre," and its ineffectual attempts to move off;
"when having cut a twig," he continued, "I went up to
it, and tapped it on the head, which it raised, as well as
its tail, and began for the first time to rattle."
</p>

<p>
Now every careful reader of this remarkable story,
provided he is at all conversant with the habits of snakes,
will perceive that it could not possibly have been invented,
for it is strictly and minutely in accord with facts,
except in one important particular; the snake whose behavior
Audubon watched and so accurately described
was not the rattlesnake, but the blue racer or black snake
(<i>Bascanion constrictor</i>); substitute "blue racer," for
"rattlesnake," and this record is photographically correct.<a name='FA_61' id='FA_61' href='#FN_61' class='fnanchor'>[61]</a>
The black snake does all the things which are
here so minutely described—pursuing its prey with astounding
agility, constricting about it as a prelude to
swallowing it, ascending trees readily, coiling when
brought to bay as if about to strike, and even vibrating
the tip of its tail on the ground or leaves, as if in emulation
of the genuine rattler, a kind of behavior which
was looked upon by Darwin as a case of protective mimicry.
No one could have known the rattlesnake better
than Audubon from his constant encounters with it in
the field; he made drawings of it, dissected its poison
apparatus, and had kept it for months in confinement in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
order to study its habits; but by some curious twist of
his notes or his memory, or led astray by the record
made of the rattling habit, the species became confused
in his published account. His error was gross and he
paid dearly for it, but it certainly does not prove him to
be the king of nature fakirs.
</p>

<p>
Audubon's critics were probably right in affirming
that the rattlesnake never ascends trees for the purpose
of destroying birds, but some overshot the mark by denying
that the reptile was able to climb at all. Nor could
it have been said with greater justice that the
brilliant but sluggish coral snake (<i>Elaps fulvius</i>), which
Audubon had also placed in a tree,<a name='FA_62' id='FA_62' href='#FN_62' class='fnanchor'>[62]</a> really never aspires
to this distinction. When the snake controversy was
waxing warm in America, a number of Audubon's
friends, including Colonel John J. Abert<a name='FA_63' id='FA_63' href='#FN_63' class='fnanchor'>[63]</a> and Richard
C. Taylor,<a name='FA_64' id='FA_64' href='#FN_64' class='fnanchor'>[64]</a> investigated the question and proved that
the rattlesnake was a ready climber at certain times
of the year and under certain conditions, a fact which
is now better known. Mr. Taylor's party in the course
of explorations in the Alleghanies killed forty-one large
rattlesnakes during the month of August on a single
ridge bordering the Lycoming Valley, and in rendering
his report, this geologist said: "I have repeatedly endeavored
to verify Mr. Audubon's account of the rattlesnake
ascending trees, which has been confirmed."
</p>

<p>
We have already referred to Audubon's meeting
with Thomas Cooper at Columbia, South Carolina, in
October, 1833. This versatile man, sometime English
lawyer, revolutionist in France, friend of Priestley,
judge in the Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
professor of chemistry in Dickinson College as well as
in the University of Pennsylvania, and at this time
president of South Carolina College at Columbia, was
able to confirm Audubon's account of the climbing habit
of the rattlesnake, and probably wrote this statement
at his request:

About three weeks ago, my son and two of my black servants,
observed a very large rattle snake climbing up the fence
that separates my garden from the road, at my country house.
The snake put himself in the attitude of striking; whereupon
one of the men ran for a gun, and shot the snake on the last
rail but one of the fence. The snake was 4.3 long; as thick as
my wrist, and had seven rattles.

</p>

<p>
Waterton maintained that Audubon's drawing of
the rattlesnake, to which we have referred, was a monstrosity,
"a fabulous Hydra, with its eyes starting out
of their sockets," and a point repeatedly ridiculed was
his representation of the fangs as slightly recurved, or
bent up at their tips. Who had ever heard of such an
anomaly? Certainly not the doughty lord of "Walton
Hall," who declared that the fangs of poisonous snakes
were always curved like a scythe, with their points bent
downwards. Waterton prided himself on his knowledge
of these reptiles, and certainly was not lacking in self-confidence.
According to his own account, he went
eleven months in the forests of Brazil without shoe or
stocking to his foot, and on a certain occasion in London
secured with his hands and removed from its cage a live
rattlesnake; but, like so many sophisticated writers on
natural history, he took to analogy like a duck to water.
</p>

<p>
Waterton's statement sounds plausible enough, but
obviously could be proved only by extensive observations
and comparisons. When Audubon was proceeding
up Galveston Bay to Houston, Texas, in the spring
of 1837, with his son, John, and Edward Harris, they
stopped at the plantation of Colonel James Morgan,
near Red Fish Bar. "There, among other rarities," said
he, "we procured a fine specimen of the climbing rattlesnake
with <i>recurved</i> fangs, which with several others
of the same kind, is now in my possession."<a name='FA_65' id='FA_65' href='#FN_65' class='fnanchor'>[65]</a> In writing
to Thomas M. Brewer, from Charleston, on June
12 of this year, he alluded to this subject as follows: "I
must not forget to say to you that I had the good fortune
to procure specimens of my 'Climbing Rattlesnake
with DOUBLE <i>recurved fangs</i>' which, I
am told, will prove a new genus! and therefore the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
Messrs. Ord and Waterton—<i>good souls!</i>—will be perfectly
delighted at the sight of this strange reptile."<a name='FA_66' id='FA_66' href='#FN_66' class='fnanchor'>[66]</a>
Unfortunately a large part of Audubon's collections
made upon this expedition were lost. I have seen no
other reference to this extraordinary peculiarity, and
there the matter seems to have rested until the present
time.
</p>

<p>
Audubon's judgment or memory might play him
false, but his pencil, in such a matter, could be relied
upon to tell the truth. It is therefore a pleasure to be
able to confirm his accuracy in reference to the serpent's
tooth, for the true representation of which he was roundly
abused during his lifetime. The reader will perceive
the point by examining the accompanying photograph,
which represents the skull of a large diamond-backed
specimen from Florida.<a name='FA_67' id='FA_67' href='#FN_67' class='fnanchor'>[67]</a> In the prairie rattlesnake,
and probably in some others, the fangs are sickle-shaped,
as Waterton maintained, but upwards of eleven species
of rattlesnakes have been found on the continent of
North America, and, true to Audubon's disputed drawing
and account, in this Florida specimen the fangs are
<i>slightly</i>, but <i>very distinctly, bent upwards at their tips</i>!
Let nature writers, inclined to the easy path of analogy,
remember the rattlesnake's fang, for it teaches a salutary
lesson.

<p>
As I have not hesitated to speak of Audubon's real
or supposed mistakes, I will give another and more striking
instance of his tardy vindication. In his plate of the
American Swan (No. ccccxi), which was published in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
1838, there is represented a yellow water lily, under the
name of <i>Nymphaea lutea</i>. Since this lily was then quite
unknown to botanists, it was ignored and treated as a
fable, or as an extravagant vagary of the naturalist's
imagination, until the summer of 1876, when it was rediscovered
in Florida by Mrs. Mary Treat. Audubon's
long lost lily was then identified and acknowledged by
Professor Asa Gray, the botanist, who, with poetic justice,
proposed to rename it after the discredited enthusiast,
in view of the fact that it had been originally discovered
and faithfully depicted by him a generation
before.
</p>

<p>
While the snake controversy was acute in America,
another of a purely academic character, which assumed
even wider proportions, was started on the smelling
powers of the vulture. We have already seen a reference
to this in the naturalist's letter to his son, Victor, written
at Charleston, where he was conducting with Bachman
a new series of experiments to settle the question.<a name='FA_68' id='FA_68' href='#FN_68' class='fnanchor'>[68]</a> The
idea, commonly accepted, that the scavengers of the
Southern States were possessed of a keenness of scent
comparable with that of a beagle hound, had been vigorously
combated by Audubon, who showed by numerous
experiments<a name='FA_69' id='FA_69' href='#FN_69' class='fnanchor'>[69]</a> that they were guided to their prey
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
by the sense of sight only; thus it was found that they
would come readily to the effigy of a calf or sheep painted
on canvas and set up in plain view, or to a skin stuffed
with straw, but failed to detect their quarry when the
dead bodies of these animals were placed on the ground
and screened from their eyes, if only by the thinnest
cover, though the carrion was calling loudly to the nose
but a fraction of an inch away. An attack by Waterton,<a name='FA_70' id='FA_70' href='#FN_70' class='fnanchor'>[70]</a>
who hurried to the fray whenever a statement in
his jealously guarded <i>Wanderings</i> was called in question,
led to a lively tilt, in which the advocates of the
nose and the eyes were sometimes humorously referred
to as the "Nosarians" and the "Anti-Nosarians," some
of the most eminent anatomists of the day eventually
taking part.
</p>

<p>
Bachman felt keenly the aspersions which were cast
upon his friend, and in the winter of 1833 he undertook
with Audubon the series of experiments to which we
have referred. The tests which were then made supported
Audubon's statements in every particular, and
the faculty of the Medical College of South Carolina
were invited as a body to witness them; this they did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
willingly, and the following memorial signed by all the
witnesses present was published by Bachman in 1834.<a name='FA_71' id='FA_71' href='#FN_71' class='fnanchor'>[71]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We, the subscribers, having witnessed several of the experiments
made on the habits of the vultures of South Carolina
(<i>Cathartes aura</i> and <i>C. atratus</i>), commonly called the
turkey buzzard and the carrion crow, feel assured that these
species respectively are gregarious, the individuals of each
species associating and feeding together; that they devour
fresh as well as putrid food of any kind, and that they are
guided to their food altogether through their sense of sight,
and not of smell.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In a letter written to Ord, on March 4, 1834, Waterton
said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
You will see that the Charleston parson [Bachman], Doctors,
Surgeons and Professors are up in arms against me and
are determined to cut off the Vulture's nose. But do not be
alarmed for me, I promise you that I will answer them to your
heart's content and tomorrow I shall send up a paper to Loudon
for his May number which will make your Philosophers
appear very small and put Audubon's claim to literature and
ornithology in so clear a light that no one will be in doubt
hereafter.... Audubon's gulled friends and supporters in
London are in the highest spirits and feel sure that I cannot
answer the Charleston letter. By the first of May next their
crowing will cease.
</p>
</div>

<p>
When anatomists came to consider the question and
found that well developed olfactory lobes and nerves
were present in these birds, they favored the theory of
smell,<a name='FA_72' id='FA_72' href='#FN_72' class='fnanchor'>[72]</a> and Edinger has more recently expressed the
opinion that this consideration renders the possession of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
an olfactory sense in such birds highly probable. His contention
is weakened, however, by the fact that granivorous
and insectivorous birds also possess true olfactory
nerves, and yet are proved by experiment to have little
or no effective sense of smell. It is a problem for students
of behavior to solve, and so far as the American
vultures are concerned, Audubon's and Bachman's experiments,
I believe, have never been repeated or extended
with sufficient care to settle the question. The
little that has been done, however, suggests that while
the vulture in its daily and never ending search for food
is mainly guided by its keen eyes, the nose, possibly,
may be a coöperating factor when the wind and other
conditions are favorable.
</p>

<p>
While critics were driving the pen, Audubon was
hard at work in the field, but his friends did not long
remain silent. Favorable notices of his work, actual or
prospective, had appeared in the scientific and literary
press of England, by David Brewster, Robert Jameson,
William Swainson, and "Christopher North" of
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>. The first American notice appeared
in the <i>American Journal of Science</i> for 1829,
and this was followed by G. W. Featherstonhaugh, the
English geologist, in his recently established but short-lived
<i>Monthly American Journal of Geology and Natural
Science</i>, to which we have already referred.<a name='FA_73' id='FA_73' href='#FN_73' class='fnanchor'>[73]</a> A
little later the London <i>Athenæum</i> gave the first of
eleven extended articles on Audubon's work; in reviewing
his second volume of letterpress, which appeared in
1834, the writer said: "There is amply sufficient remaining
in Audubon's pages for fully a dozen more notices,
were we disposed to follow the exhausting system. We
have admired Audubon's gorgeous drawings, but our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
interest in them has been increased a thousand fold,
in knowing that they are the spoils of a life's campaign."<a name='FA_74' id='FA_74' href='#FN_74' class='fnanchor'>[74]</a>
Again a series of able articles was started by
a just critic, W. B. O. Peabody, in the <i>North American
Review</i> for April, 1832.<a name='FA_75' id='FA_75' href='#FN_75' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a> Featherstonhaugh deserves
credit for having given Audubon a fair hearing
at a critical time, when baiting the American Woodsman
was a popular pastime in certain circles at Philadelphia;
in reviewing the <i>Ornithological Biography</i> in
1832, this plain spokesman gave what he called "a true
history of a conspiracy, got up to utterly break down
and ruin the reputation of one of the most remarkable
men America ever produced."<a name='FA_76' id='FA_76' href='#FN_76' class='fnanchor'>[76]</a>
</p>

<p>
Audubon's silence under fire of hostile criticism
tempted someone in the capacity of a reporter to call on
him in London to obtain, if possible, a personal statement,
but his lips were then sealed and he would only
say: "Had I wished to invent marvels, I need not have
stirred from my garret in New York or London."
However, in writing to Featherstonhaugh from Bulowville,
East Florida, December 31, 1831, Audubon made
this comment:<a name='FA_77' id='FA_77' href='#FN_77' class='fnanchor'>[77]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
If I did not believe the day to be gone by when it was
necessary to defend my snake stories, I could send you many
curious accounts of the habits of those reptiles; and I should
do it, if it were not that I might be thought to enjoy—too
much that triumph which the feeble hostility of three or four
selfish individuals has forced upon me. I receive so many acts
of real friendship and disinterested kindness, that, I thank
God, there is no room left in my heart to cherish unkind feelings
towards any one. Indeed, I am not now so much surprised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
at the incredulity of persons who do not leave cities,
for I occasionally hear of things which even stagger me, who
am so often a denizen of woods and swamps. What do you
think of rattlesnakes taking to the water, and swimming across
inlets and rivers? I have not seen this, but I believe it; since
the most respectable individuals assure me they have frequently
been eye-witnesses of this feat. I can conceive of inducements
which reptiles may have for traversing sheets of
water to gain dry land, especially in a country much intersected
by streams, and subject to inundations, which compel
them to be often in the water. In such countries, it is not an
uncommon occurrence to find snakes afloat and at great distances
from the shore. This appears, no doubt, surprising to
those who live where there is almost nothing but dry land;
still they ought to be good natured, and believe what others
have seen. It has now been made notorious, that numerous
respectable individuals, whom duty, or the love of adventure,
have led into the woods of our country, have often seen snakes—and
the rattlesnake too—in trees; the good people, therefore,
who pass their lives in stores and counting houses, ought
not to contradict these facts, because they do not meet with
rattlesnakes, hissing and snapping at them from the paper
mulberries, as they go home to their dinners....
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon's most persistent heckler was Charles
Waterton,<a name='FA_78' id='FA_78' href='#FN_78' class='fnanchor'>[78]</a> who during two of his most prolific years,
1833 and 1834, published no less than fourteen lucubrations
against the "foreigner," and "stranger" as the
American was called; all were characterized by quizzing
interrogatories, shallow criticism and personal vituperation,
for the most part unworthy of serious consideration.
Long noted for his eccentricities, Waterton had
little or no standing among English zoölogists, against
many of whom, from time to time, he issued broadsides
or breezy polemics, whenever their statements cast a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
shadow on his <i>Wanderings</i>. Some of these accusing articles
were answered by Victor Audubon and other
friends of the naturalist, but they never drew his own
fire; probably they benefited him in the end, for when
it appeared that the charges brought against him were
in large measure the work of envious calumniators, a
strong current set in his favor on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
When Audubon's name was first proposed for membership
in the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia,
it was rejected, according to report, through
the influence of George Ord and a few of his partisans,
while Waterton, who was Mr. Ord's close friend and
correspondent, affirmed that Audubon was rejected by
the Society on the strength of Alexander Wilson's personal
diary,<a name='FA_79' id='FA_79' href='#FN_79' class='fnanchor'>[79]</a> a statement which appears to be utterly
incredible.<a name='FA_80' id='FA_80' href='#FN_80' class='fnanchor'>[80]</a>
</p>

<p>
In 1833, two years after the first volume of Audubon's
"Biography of Birds" had made its appearance,
Waterton raised another controversy, in this instance
with ammunition supplied by his friend, George Ord
of Philadelphia. He boldly proclaimed<a name='FA_81' id='FA_81' href='#FN_81' class='fnanchor'>[81]</a> that Audubon
was not the author of the work which bore his name,
a charge similar to that which had been brought to
the door of the French ornithologist, Le Vaillant, whose
history resembled Audubon's in many ways. "I request
the English reader," said Waterton, "to weigh well in
his own mind what I have stated, and I flatter myself
that he will agree with me, when I affirm that the correct
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
and elegant style of composition which appears
through the <i>whole of the Biography of Birds</i> cannot
possibly be that of him whose name it bears." Waterton
maintained that, while Audubon's earlier papers
were the work of an illiterate person, his <i>Biography</i>
betrayed the hand of a finished scholar from beginning
to end. In a reply to Victor Audubon, written July 6,
1833,<a name='FA_82' id='FA_82' href='#FN_82' class='fnanchor'>[82]</a> Waterton declared, upon the authority of
George Ord, whom he quoted, that William Swainson
had been importuned to write Audubon's work for him,
but declined when Audubon insisted upon his own name
being given to the world as author. This direct accusation
called forth an immediate explanation from Swainson,
who said:<a name='FA_83' id='FA_83' href='#FN_83' class='fnanchor'>[83]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In reply to that gentleman (G. Ord, Esq.), regarding the
assistance it was expected I should have given my friend,
Mr. Audubon, in the <i>scientific</i> details of his work, my reply
was, that the negotiation had been broken off from an unwillingness
that my name should be printed on the title-page.
I was not asked to write the work, nor did Mr. Audubon "insist
upon his own name being given to the world as the author"
of such parts as he wished me to undertake.... I have read
Mr. Audubon's original manuscripts, and I have read Mr.
Waterton's original manuscripts. I think the English of one
is as good as the English of the other—but here the comparison
ends."
</p>
</div>

<p>
The controversy thus started did not reflect much credit
on Audubon's detractors, but reverberations of the
charge were heard at a much later day.
</p>

<p>
Robert Bakewell, the geologist, who was a relative
of Mrs. Audubon, then living at Hampstead, entered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
this controversy, and in June, 1833, replied<a name='FA_84' id='FA_84' href='#FN_84' class='fnanchor'>[84]</a> to one of
Waterton's fulminations, which he attributed to envy
and jealousy, saying that posterity would regard Audubon
as "the most distinguished ornithologist of the
present age."
</p>

<p>
Charles Waterton began his travels at eighteen, but
early settled down to a life of leisurely independence on
his ancestral estate in Yorkshire, where he studied birds
to little purpose and wrote extensively on natural-history
subjects; he is best known for his <i>Wanderings</i>,<a name='FA_85' id='FA_85' href='#FN_85' class='fnanchor'>[85]</a>
which has passed through numerous editions and is still
read. From youth Waterton enjoyed exceptional advantages,
and according to one of his biographers, "lived
to extreme old age without having wasted an hour or a
shilling." He was the twenty-seventh "lord of Walton
Hall," the manor house of the family, which stood on
an island in a lake; the estate of 260 acres was mainly
converted into a preserve for wild birds. His young
wife died in 1829, after having given birth to a son, and
he lived on his paternal acres in semi-retirement ever
after. It was said that Waterton would never don
evening clothes or a black coat, but insisted on wearing
a blue frock with gold buttons until an anxious policeman
in the neighboring village of Wakefield persuaded
him to make a change; he told the Reverend J. G. Wood
in 1863 that he had been bled 160 times, mostly by his
own hand. When, in his sixty-ninth year, he had the
misfortune to fall from a pear tree and break an elbow
joint, the first remedy tried was the extraction of thirty
ounces of blood; shortly after this a careless servant
withdrew a chair as he was seating himself at table, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
thirty more ounces were immediately required. The
wage of one of his laborers is said to have sufficed for
his personal needs, and his sleeping apartment had
neither bed, chair, nor carpet; he lay on bare boards,
wrapped in a blanket, with an oaken block for pillow;
and he is said to have never tasted fermented liquor and
to have eaten but sparingly of meat. His daily habit
was to retire at eight and rise at three o'clock in the
morning, and he was always dressed by four; an ardent
Roman Catholic, he would spend an hour at devotion in
his private chapel; he then read Latin and Spanish authors,
wrote his polemics against Audubon or any others
with whom he came in conflict, and received the reports
of his bailiff, all before breakfast, which was at
eight o'clock; the remainder of the day was mostly devoted
to his birds and other animals, to preserve which
he surrounded his entire estate with a high rampart of
stone, said to have cost, all told, $50,000.
</p>

<p>
Though a devout Romanist, as someone has remarked,
Waterton never hesitated to adopt the same
mode of reasoning which Hume had employed in his
argument against miracles. Thus he rejected with scorn
Edward Jenner's account of how the young parasitic
Cuckoo, when but a day old and hardly able to stand,
turned out of their nest its rightful occupants. This
account, which was generally accepted then, and has
been repeatedly verified and recorded by the camera
since, "carries," said Waterton, "its own condemnation,
no matter by whom related, or by whom received."
Trusting to analogy again, he maintained that Audubon's
description of the Ruby-throated Hummingbird
gluing bits of lichen to the surface of its nest with
saliva was false, because "the saliva of all birds immediately
mixes with water," and the first shower of rain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
would immediately undo the work of the bird. No account
was taken of the Chimney Swift, which not only
glues together the twigs of its nest but secures the
whole to a support through an abundant salivary secretion,
although this habit had long been known. In the
instance of this hummingbird, however, both Audubon
and Waterton were partly right and partly wrong, as
a careful examination of the nests of five species of
hummingbirds, including the Ruby-throat, has clearly
shown.<a name='FA_86' id='FA_86' href='#FN_86' class='fnanchor'>[86]</a> It proved that saliva was only casually used
on the surface of the nest, the lichens in the case referred
to being adherent by means of spiders' silk and fine vegetable
fibers of various sorts; the saliva of the Ruby-throat,
when dry, moreover, was found to be practically
insoluble in cold water, even after an immersion of several
days; but more interesting than this is the fact that
the nest itself is <i>glued</i> to its supporting twig by a large
<i>salivary wafer</i>, which represents this hummingbird's first
step in the work of nest construction.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after his arrival at Edinburgh, and before
he had published anything, Audubon wrote in his journal
on November 5, 1826: "I returned home early and
found a note from Mr. John Gregg, who came himself
later, bringing me a scrubby letter from Charles Waterton,"
so it would appear that the lord of "Walton Hall"
had been warned to keep an eye on the dangerous American,
and Waterton's American correspondent was Mr.
Ord, of Philadelphia. Later on Waterton wrote to
Swainson an extraordinary letter of some four thousand
words,<a name='FA_87' id='FA_87' href='#FN_87' class='fnanchor'>[87]</a> afterwards published in his <i>Essays on Natural
History</i>, which for petty vanity and personal animosity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
has seldom been surpassed, but with this effort his ammunition
seems to have been exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Charles Waterton, who lived to his eighty-third year,
and who wrote nineteen polemics against Audubon and
his friends, was probably sincere in his attacks upon the
American Woodsman, whom he seems to have regarded
as a dangerous charlatan. Waterton was a curious
compound of fearless independence, kindness, credulity,
pedantry, vanity, and intolerance. He should be given
credit, however, for having done much to spread abroad
a love of natural history and for his attitude towards
an artificial system of classification, then much in vogue,
which, though only an amateur, he had the good sense
to reject.

SIDELIGHTS ON AUDUBON AND HIS
CONTEMPORARIES

What was a Quinarian?—Controversy over the authorship of the
<i>Ornithological Biography</i>—Audubon's quaint proposal—Swainson's
reply—Friendship suffers a check—Species-mongers—Hitting at one
over the shoulders of another—Swainson as a biographer—His career—Bonaparte's

</p>

<p>
Few, probably, ever attain marked success in their
chosen field without exciting jealous rivalry or misrepresentation
on the part of some of their contemporaries.
Audubon was no exception to the rule, but in this respect
he has been subject to so much misunderstanding that
the reader is entitled to know the truth, whenever it can
be ascertained. An instance of this sort was furnished
by the English naturalist, William Swainson, whose
relations with Audubon have been touched upon in
earlier chapters.
</p>

<p>
In April, 1828, Swainson published an eulogistic account
of some of Audubon's plates, and shortly after
they became good friends, as their familiar letters already
reproduced amply testify;<a name='FA_88' id='FA_88' href='#FN_88' class='fnanchor'>[88]</a> in the autumn of that
year, as we have related, they visited Paris together,
and they kept up a correspondence for a number of
years. At this time Swainson was known as a systematic
zoölogist of merit and an excellent draughtsman, having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
published a series of "Zoölogical Illustrations" that
seem to have been well received. Moreover, as early as
1824, he had adopted the notorious "Circular System"
of the classification of animals, and at this time was
its most zealous advocate in England. The tenets of
this curious doctrine, often called "Quinarianism" from
the recurrence of the number <i>5</i>, was confused in a mystical
jargon which conveys little meaning to a reader of
today; it was derived from William Sharp MacLeay,
who had advocated a similar system in his <i>Horae Entomologicae</i>,
published in 1821. According to Swainson's
creed, "all things that have life have been created upon
one plan, and this plan is founded on the principle of a
series of affinities returning into themselves; which can
only be represented by a circle." "This sublime discovery,"
which, as Swainson thought, was sufficient "to immortalize
a name," was duly attributed to his "illustrious
countryman."<a name='FA_89' id='FA_89' href='#FN_89' class='fnanchor'>[89]</a>
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1830, when Audubon was ready
to prepare the letterpress of his mammoth plates and
needed assistance in its technical details, he applied to
his friend Swainson, who, as we have seen, was then
living at a farmstead in the Hertfordshire country, not
far from St. Albans.<a name='FA_90' id='FA_90' href='#FN_90' class='fnanchor'>[90]</a> Some of the letters which passed
between the two naturalists after the return of the former
to England, in the spring of that year, will now
be given, without amelioration or change of any sort. It
should be remembered that Swainson at this time was
in an overwrought state, since he was dependent mainly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
upon his scientific writings for the support of a family
of five children, oppressed by pecuniary difficulties, and,
no doubt, irritated by lack of success and the rebuffs
which a leading part in the Quinarian movement was
certain to entail. Audubon's letter<a name='FA_91' id='FA_91' href='#FN_91' class='fnanchor'>[91]</a> which follows
served to answer that of Swainson, bearing date of
January 30, 1830,<a name='FA_92' id='FA_92' href='#FN_92' class='fnanchor'>[92]</a> had been received in America
but too late for the fulfillment of its commissions.
References to Audubon's "book," which unfortunately
proved a stumbling block in the path of friendship,
are noticed here and in Swainson's reply for the
first time.

<p>
You may be assured that nothing but an over [<i>word undecipherable</i>]

writing to you sooner, Yet I would have had the pleasure of
announcing you my return to good old England had I not been
informed by Mr. Havell that you we apraised of it when last
in town &amp; that more over you were quite well.—I hope that
your kind wife and children are equally so and happy.—I
brought my good wife with me to Liverpool where she is for
a while with her sister Mrs. Gordon &amp; the family Rathbourn.
We had a rough voyage of 25 days &amp; glad to be back on this
hospitable shore. I am sorry to say that your last letter to
me (I presume) did not reach me in time to enable me to
procure either squirrels or birds for you.—I have indeed
brought about 150 birds and some of them good singers and
beautifull but all are on Double Elephant Paper—they may
and I hope they will please your eyes, when I have the satisfaction
to shake you by the hand the first time you come to

town.—I called on Mr. Lea at Philadelphia, but he told me
that you had countermanded your wishes to me &amp; has given
me a memorandum to that effect—Mr. Gilpin on whom I also
called told me that your travelling boxes had forward<span class="sup">d</span>. I
saw Mr. Ward at New York he is doing <i>extremely well</i> if what
he told me is true. I saw M. le Comte also.—I have just
taken the Reins of my Mammoth Publication which by the way
I am glad to find in a good way of process or progress. I am
greatly indebted to Mr. Children and grateful to him—Havell
has done his part I think well and now I will set about procuring
subscriptions with new ardour. Now in return of this
packet of information I am very desirous to know what you
are engaged at present in the way of science; I feel as if I
had a world of talk for you.—Bonaparte's 4th volume is printing
have you seen the third? I have it at Liverpool by this
time.—I wrote to the author this morning.—I am well pleased
with my voyage I think it will be of material advantage to my
work my health &amp; my comfort—We have left our two sons
quite well and doing well at the Falls of the Ohio where I killed
a fine Turkey about <i>forty days since</i>. Those sent to the Zoological
Gardens alive have had ill luck. They received only one
and 3 Oppossums—The blue Gias [?] and Parakets are not yet
arrived, and Mr. Rathbone as well as Mr. Shepherd told me
(to my great sorrow) that the last shipment of 10,000 forest
trees were all dead. How did those sent to you?—I have
commenced the having a complete collection of the Birds of
America in skins &amp; have instituted some agents in the U. S.
to provide for me. So much have I seen of those dear creatures
of the feathered creation that I feel even now as if I heard
their notes and saw their all elegant movements.—I am going to
<i>write a book!</i> but more of this when we meet.—do you know
that the poor woodsman who now is scribling to you will take
his seat at the Royal Society of London tomorrow—the very
words make my head whirl and I will stand it I do not know—I

Welcome once more, my good friend to merry England:
</p>

<p>
I had indeed heard from Havell, with the greatest pleasure,
that you had safely landed at Liverpool; and I regret very
much that you did not reach London before I had left it; for
I am now much seldomer in town than formerly, and I know
not when I may have the power to do so again. My old and
most valued friend Mr. Burchell has also, to my great delight,
just returned to England after <i>six years</i> spent in wandering
over the Forests and Andes of South America bringing with
him collections, that will make everything else in this country
<i>sink into utter insignificance</i>, he too, is longing to see me, and
if I possibly can get away for a day next week, with two such
desirable objects I will, but my literary engagements bind me,
hand and foot.
</p>

<p>
You think that I do not know that you are an F. R. S.—you
are mistaken, furthermore, you will be surprised at knowing
I have been fighting your battles against a rising opposition
which originated among some of your <i>Ornithological
friends</i> (at least so I strongly suspect) for the purpose of
your name being <i>blackballed</i>. But more of this when we meet,
such matters had better not be committed to paper.
</p>

<p>
The whole of your bundle of young trees reached me as
withered sticks, not a spark of life in any one of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
</p>

<p>
So you are going to write a book 'tis a thing of little
moment for one who is not known, because they have no reputation
to loose, but much will be expected from <i>you</i>, and you
must, therefore, as the saying is, <i>put your best leg foremost</i>.
I am coming fast round to the prejudice, as you may think it,
against the Americans.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Richardson's and my own volume on the Arctic Birds,
is now in press. Not being able to refer to your plates, I have
not had the power to quote your work, you know how repeatedly
I have applied on this head, both to you and Mr. Havell in
vain.
</p>

<p>
Prince C. Bonaparte has long promised me his second &amp;
third volume but they have never come. Ward<a name='FA_93' id='FA_93' href='#FN_93' class='fnanchor'>[93]</a> is a regular
<i>Scamp</i> he has taught me a good lesson—fool that he is—and
that is, to steal my heart against distress such as his
was, and to consult, like all the rest of the world, my own
interest only. I am sick of the world and of mankind, and
but for my family would end my days in my beloved forests of
Brazil.
</p>

<p>
So Mr. Lea<a name='FA_94' id='FA_94' href='#FN_94' class='fnanchor'>[94]</a> did not settle my account with you? I have
found <i>him out</i>, also, to be no better than he should be. He
also is one of your <i>friends</i> who would, if he could, cut your
throat. Another <i>friend</i> of yours has been in England, Mr.
Ord and has been doing you all the <i>good</i> he can: if these are
samples of American Naturalists, defend me from ever coming
in contact with any of their whole race.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Swainson's health I am grieved to say, has suffered
much the last twelve months, she is now at Birmingham with
the children. I have not failed to mention your kind inquiries
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
after both, whenever Havell has a parcel for me, I hope you
will occasionally accompany it with a few lines.

As already noticed, Audubon started on a canvassing

letter to Swainson, but he changed his plans, and
instead of returning to London, went to Edinburgh, and
again settled there for the winter.

It should be noticed that the revolution in France

in the person of Louis Philippe, was seated on the
throne the day the following letter<a name='FA_95' id='FA_95' href='#FN_95' class='fnanchor'>[95]</a> was written; very
likely Audubon was not reluctant to change his plan of
visiting Paris after hearing of these events, although he
had enjoyed an interview with the new king, who was
his patron.

as you was on the point of leaving London, when you

birds and the Painted Buntlings also the Pinecreeping Warbler.

I do not expect that these most wonderful events in France
will deter you from going, seeing that everything is now quiet.
The french are certainly a great nation. I never had such an

I suppose you will be at the Dinner to Cuvier on Tuesday,

From Manchester Audubon sent Swainson this letter,

<p>
At the time that I sent you the Woodpeckers skins, I had
not a moment to spare or be assured I would have answered
your note—When I opened my boxes of skins I had the mortification
to find most of them touched by insects—I felt a
desire that those nondescribed specimen[s] which I had should
go to a public institution &amp; I therefore presented them to the

British Museum through my friend Children—I sent others to
New Castle upon Tyne some to this place and some to our
friends Selby &amp; Sir Wm Jardine.—respecting the Woodpeckers
which you look upon as knew I will merely say that if for instance
it differs from all others known by having the top of the
head entirely red that it may be a young bird, I say this because
I do not know if you are acquainted with the fact that
almost all the Woodpecker tribe have this in their youth more
or less extended but after the first moult they assume the red
in the form they are to wear it during life. I sent you a young
of the Downy in that state—and if I recollect well also one of
the Golden Winged—had you sent me your specimen, I <i>think</i>
I could assisted you in determining if or no it is a new bird.—should
you become satisfied on that head, and I am honoured
with its being named after me, I will feel gratified and thankful
to you.—Mrs. Audubon is with me &amp; we are bound to the
Scotch Lakes &amp; will return in about 2 months.—I am desirous
to hear from you if you can have the time to spare &amp; the inclination
to <i>Bear a hand</i> in the text of my work.—by my
furnishing you with the ideas &amp; observations which I have and
you to add <i>the science which I have not</i>!—If it would suit you

being almost always together I could partake of your observations
&amp; you of mine.—I would like to receive here your ideas
on this subject &amp; if possible what amount you would expect
from us as remuneration.—My first volume will comprise an introduction
and <i>one hundred letters addressed to the Reader</i>
referring to the 100 plates forming the first volume of my

<p class="post">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Audubon</span>.
</p>

<p>
I received your letter yesterday, and hasten to reply to
it. By some mistake or other, of Havell's, he has not sent the
birds to which you allude, and I did not of course know that
you had left them with him, now to your two propositions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
</p>

<p>
First, as to boarding with us, you do not know probably,
that this is never done in England, except as a matter of
necessity or profession, in which case the domestic establishment
is framed accordingly. But this consideration would
have no influence with me, in <i>your</i> case did other circumstances
allow of it. It would however be attended with so many
changes in our every-day domestic arrangements, that it becomes
impossible.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, as to the proposition I once made to you, I am
fearful you have put it out of my power to do <i>so much</i> as I
<i>might</i> have done, from your having distributed the very birds
which would have been the materials I was to work upon; and
upon which only, any scientific observations truly original,
(&amp; therefore <i>worth</i> putting into your book), must be founded.
Fortunately, however, my own collection is not poor in North
American Specimens, and these would still furnish a mass of
interesting information to <i>the Scientific</i>. It would be, however,
highly advisable that all these species which I have not,
but which you have brought home, and given away, should be
borrowed back again, without delay.
</p>

<p>
Next as to plan. I have always told you that the plan you
mention, so far as your own narrative goes, is the <i>very best</i>
which could possibly be chosen. <i>You</i> have to speak of the
birds as they are alive, <i>I</i> to speak of their outward form, structure,
and their place in the great System of their Creator, for
the true system, if I have, or anybody else, has discovered is
not a <i>Human</i> System. If my views are correct, every observation
you make, <i>plain</i>, <i>unvarnished</i>, and strictly <i>accurate</i>, will
fully and perfectly harmonize. Our parts are totally distinct,
and we have no occasion to consult with each other what we
should say at every page. Where our views may differ, I shall
not, of course, say anything. My own remarks had better be
kept distinct, in the form of "Scientific Notes" to each letter,
at the end, and in this way you will make the work, the <i>standard
authority</i> on American Ornithology, which without Science,
it certainly would not be, however interesting or valuable in
other respects.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As to time, and remuneration, I shall have completed all
my portion of Dr. Richardson's works in two months. I can
then <i>devote</i> a portion of each day to yours. The terms of my
remuneration will be those which I always receive from the
Booksellers, and which are fixed, worth twelve guineas a sheet
of the same size and Type as the Zoölogical Journal, each sheet
being 16 pages, and each page averages 390 words, the calculation
is there brought to a nicety, and you may spend as
much as you choose. If I have to revise and correct the proofs,
make alterations etc. that will be something additional, I always
charge this by the <i>time</i> each sheet takes me, and would
come to from 5/ to 7/6 a sheet but the booksellers generally
give me a round sum, which I name after trying the three first
sheets of a work, with Dr. Richardson's the case was different,
I there had 300 £ for my assistance and drawings. It would
of course be understood that my name stands in the title page
as responsible for such portion as concerns me.
</p>

<p>
Should we arrange this matter, it will be time enough to
fix on other minor points. But I should like to know your
decision soon, as I have been applied to in another quarter.
Indeed I am already so full of business, that I have two years
active employment ahead of me. I go for two days to assist
Burchell<a name='FA_97' id='FA_97' href='#FN_97' class='fnanchor'>[97]</a> in the arrangement of his African Birds prior to
publication, at the end of the month, I shall bear in mind what
you say on the Woodpecker but I have peculiar notions on
<i>Species</i>, which, as I <i>believe</i> them correct, so I do not suffer to
be influenced by others, you will see more of this in my Book
of American Birds.<a name='FA_98' id='FA_98' href='#FN_98' class='fnanchor'>[98]</a> Our kindest remembrance to Mrs. Audubon,
and always look upon me as your sincere, but very plain
spoken friend,

Audubon's next letter, which was written from Manchester

<h4>
<i>William Swainson to Audubon</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="post">
<span class="smcap">My dr Sir</span>
</p>

<p>
I have refrained from replying to your letter until I
thought you had returned to London.
</p>

<p>
Either you do not appear to have understood the nature of
my proposition on supplying scientific information for your
work, or you are very erroneously informed on the matter in
which such assistance is usually given. Dr. Richardson, and
a hundred others, similarly situated, might with equal justice
say that no name should appear but their own; as it would
rob them of their fame, because notes are furnished by one or
two other persons, your friends would tell you, if you enquired
of them, that even <i>my</i> name would <i>add</i> something to the value
of the "The Birds of America". You pay me compliments on
my scientific knowledge, and wished you possessed a portion;
&amp; you liken the acquisition of such a portion to purchasing the
sketch of an eminent painter—the simile is good, but allow
me to ask you, whether, after procuring the sketch, you would
mix it up with your own, and pass it off to your friends as
your production? I cannot possibly suppose that such would
be your duplicity and I therefore must not suppose that you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
intended that I should give all the scientific information I
have laboured to acquire during twenty years on ornithology—conceal
my name,—and transfer my fame to your pages &amp;
to your reputation.
</p>

<p>
Few have enjoyed the opportunity of benefiting by the advice
and assistance of a scientific friend so much as yourself;
and no one, I must be allowed to say, has evinced so little inclination
to profit by it. When I call to mind the repeated
offers I have made you to correct the nomenclature of your
birds, from the first time of our acquaintance, and recollect
the dislike you appeared to have to receiving any such information
or correction, I cannot but feel perfect surprize at
you now wishing to profit by that aid, you have hitherto been
so indifferent about.
</p>

<p>
Let me however urge upon you one advise which, for your
own sake, I should be sorry you despised. It is to characterize
yourself, or get some friend to do so for you, all your new
species. The specimens, you tell me, are now in England, &amp; the
task will be comparatively easy. I urge this, because you may
not be aware that a new species, deposited in a museum, is of no
authority whatsoever, <i>until its name and its character are</i>
published. I have repeatedly set my face against such authorities,
so has Mr. Vigors, so has Ch. Bonaparte, and on this head
we are all perfectly unanimous. Unless, therefore, this is done,
you will, I am fearful, loose the credit of discovering nearly
all the new species you possess, and this I again repeat, for
your own sake I should be sorry for. To me, individually, your
not doing so, would rather be advantageous.
</p>

<p>
The more a book is quoted, the more is its merits admitted,
and its authority established. it was on this account I so
repeatedly requested the <i>use</i> only, of a copy of your book,
that it might have been cited in "Northern Zoölogy"<a name='FA_100' id='FA_100' href='#FN_100' class='fnanchor'>[100]</a> not
having it—I could not therefore mention it.
</p>

<p>
I shall always be as thankful to you as formerly for any
information on the habits, economy, and manners of birds;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
but, as to <i>species</i>, I want not, nor do I ever ask, the opinions
of any one. that is quite a different matter, and entertaining
peculiar ideas on that subject, you must not feel surprised at
my differing from you in almost every instance. My reasons
will always be laid before the public. In the present case, we
totally differ about <i>species</i> of Woodpeckers. I shall not, however
propitiate a favourable opinion from you, or any one, by
a compliment and therefore I will wait for some species which
you yourself will admit, which I shall then give your name to,
I am rather glad you did not accept my offer, for I am <i>now</i>
assisting in bringing out an Octavo edition of Wilson, by Sir
W Jardine which will be arranged according to <i>my</i> nomenclature.

<p>
The letter just quoted naturally served as a check
to their intimacy, but Audubon did not withdraw his
friendly hand, as shown by his letters to follow later,
though his answer to this has not been preserved.<a name='FA_101' id='FA_101' href='#FN_101' class='fnanchor'>[101]</a>
</p>

<p>
Audubon reached Edinburgh early in October, soon
after receiving Swainson's decisive reply, and immediately
made an arrangement with MacGillivray, as already
related.<a name='FA_102' id='FA_102' href='#FN_102' class='fnanchor'>[102]</a> It is evident from Swainson's letter
that when Audubon called upon him for editorial aid,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
he was by no means ready to defer to him wholly in
the matter of naming his birds, a subject in which Swainson
regarded himself as the first of living authorities.
Swainson's pride was also wounded at Audubon's apparent
lack of appreciation of the weight which his name
would carry if allowed to grace the title pages of his
works, and he speaks of Audubon as if he were ready
to bargain for scientific information but determined to
withhold that credit which is every writer's just due.
It is only fair to say that Swainson's vanity seems to
have outrun his candor, for when the controversy over
the authorship of Audubon's <i>Biography of Birds</i> was
started in 1833, he publicly denied that any such proposal
had been made.<a name='FA_103' id='FA_103' href='#FN_103' class='fnanchor'>[103]</a> According to Swainson's own
statement, quoted earlier, Audubon was ready to grant
him whatever credit was due, but it is evident that he
was not then disposed to adopt Swainson's peculiar
ideas upon the classification of birds or to enter upon
a thoroughgoing arrangement of joint authorship.
Though no philosopher himself, it seems clear that the
American woodsman was by no means disposed to swallow
all the vagaries of the "Circular System" to which
his friend was committed, and which was later held up
to ridicule.
</p>

<p>
The craze for describing new species of animals was
all too common in both England and America at the time
of which we write; the chief aim of many naturalists
seems to have been to attach their names to as many
of nature's forms as possible. Swainson, who "never
went to bed without describing a new species," as Audubon
said at a later time, had admonished his friend above
all else to hasten to publish descriptions of every new
bird which he had obtained in America, lest he lose
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
credit for the discovery; but Audubon, who had not
hesitated to poke fun at the species-mongering Rafinesque,
was still inclined to look with disdain upon work
of this sort. He not only rejected Swainson's advice
but answered it rather tartly in the first volume of his
letterpress, which appeared in the following year. A passage
which caused the naturalist no little annoyance on
another score was as follows:<a name='FA_104' id='FA_104' href='#FN_104' class='fnanchor'>[104]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Since I became acquainted with Mr. Alexander Wilson, the
celebrated author of the well known and duly appreciated
work on American Birds, and subsequently with my excellent
friend, Charles Lucien Bonaparte, I have been aware of the
keenness with which every student of Natural History presses
forward to describe an object of his discovery, or that may
have occurred to travellers in distant countries. There seems
to be a pride, a glory in doing this, that thrusts aside every
other consideration; and I really believe that the ties of friendship
itself would not prevent some naturalists from even robbing
an old acquaintance of the merit of first describing a
previously unknown object. Although I have certainly felt
very great pleasure, when, on picking up a bird, I discovered
it to be new to me, yet I have never known the desire above
alluded to. This feeling I still cherish; and in spite of the
many injunctions which I have received from naturalists far
more eminent than I can ever expect to be, I have kept, and still
keep, unknown to others, the species, which, not finding portrayed
in any published work, I look upon as new, having only
given in my Illustrations a number of them proportionate to
the drawings of already known species that have been engraved.
Attached to the descriptions of these, you will find the place
and date of their discovery. I do not, however, intend to claim
any merit for these discoveries, and should have liked as well
that the objects of them had been previously known, as this
would have saved some unbelievers the trouble of searching for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
them in books, and the disappointment of finding them actually
new. I assure you, good reader, that, even at this moment, I
should have less pleasure in presenting to the scientific world a
new bird, the knowledge of whose habits I do not possess, than
in describing the peculiarities of one long since discovered.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is a pity that Audubon did not maintain so admirable
an attitude towards the description of new species
as was here expressed, but at the close of his career in
England, when he desired to make his work on American
ornithology as complete as possible, he appeared as
keen to describe and publish new birds as any of his
contemporaries.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after his return to London in the spring of
1831, Audubon sent Swainson the following letter with
a copy of the first volume of his <i>Biography</i> of Birds, but
his one-time friend was not the author of an extended
and impartial review of the work, which appeared in the
<i>Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal</i> in the same
year.<a name='FA_105' id='FA_105' href='#FN_105' class='fnanchor'>[105]</a>

<span class="smcap">My dear Mr Swainson</span>,
</p>

<p>
We arrived here last evening &amp; I found your favour of the
17th instant for which I offer you my sincere thanks—I had
began to think that I was erased from your list.—I have now
the pleasure of sending you a copy of my first volume of
ornithological biography which I hope you will accept as a
small memento of the high regard I have for your self &amp; your
talents.—My inserting your name was not a matter merely of
duty but of great pleasure and believe when I say that I
never will be ungrateful to anyone who has been kind to me.—
</p>

<p>
We are going to Paris on Friday week &amp; will be absent
about a month—on the first day of August next we sail from
Liverpool to America where I intend to beat the bushes once
more—my peregrinations will extend in all probability &amp; God
willing to the Pacific Ocean into California etc—After my
return I wish to settle in England somewhere, but where is yet
undetermined.—
</p>

<p>
I have felt much grieved at reading the article of yours
respecting <i>French Naturalists</i>. I say <i>grieved</i>, because I am
always so when I see men of superior talents employing their
pen time and mind at sparring instead of peacably giving to
the world those results of their investigations &amp; experience at
all times so desired by everyone bent on studying the wonderful
laws &amp; beauties of nature. I do not wish to read a <i>lecture</i>
to you but from my heart I am sorry you should be <i>à la
joute</i> [?] with any one &amp; will conclude by sincerely hoping that
you will have no more of this sort of warfare.—
</p>

<p>
I am over head in business as you may well suppose after
an absence of 8 months but will be most happy to hear from
you. Have you heard from C. Bonaparte lately? Is he still at
Rome? it is now two months since I heard from him.—

the same yourself &amp; believe me your friend

<p>
It is interesting to notice that Swainson kept his
promise about the woodpeckers, and in 1831 named one,
which had been obtained from Louisiana, <i>Picus auduboni</i>;<a name='FA_106' id='FA_106' href='#FN_106' class='fnanchor'>[106]</a>
although Audubon later repudiated it, saying
that he believed it to represent only an immature state
of the common Downy Woodpecker, he returned the
compliment by dedicating to Swainson one of his warblers,
<i>Sylvia</i>, now <i>Helinaria, swainsonii</i>.
</p>

<p>
When William Swainson brought to a close his
labors on the <i>Cabinet Cyclopædia</i> in 1840, a part of the
eleventh volume was devoted to a biography of naturalists.<a name='FA_107' id='FA_107' href='#FN_107' class='fnanchor'>[107]</a>
In this little work Audubon was accorded a page,
Alexander Wilson received eight, while the author devoted
fourteen pages to himself. The talented MacGillivray,
whose memorable <i>History of British Birds</i>
had then advanced to its third volume, was studiously
ignored, and was referred to only in a footnote as "Mr.
Gilvray"; but he was of necessity a sharer in the following
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
criticism of Audubon's <i>Biography of Birds</i>: "a
want of precision in his descriptions, and a general ignorance
of modern ornithology sadly disappoint the scientific
reader." The technical descriptions in that work
were written, as Swainson must have known, by his
young rival, William MacGillivray, then one of the
ablest exponents of the anatomy of birds in Great Britain;
but anatomy, the master key to relationship, Swainson
affected to regard with contempt, though overzealous
friends had compared him with Cuvier, one of
the greatest masters of anatomy of all time. To follow
the comment of a later critic,<a name='FA_108' id='FA_108' href='#FN_108' class='fnanchor'>[108]</a> Swainson probably regarded
the title of "the British Cuvier" as rather derogatory,
since he had pronounced Cuvier to have been
"totally unacquainted with the very first principles of
the natural system." To Swainson, however, as the same
commentator explains, "the natural system" implied the
concept of a magical number and a circle, ideas which
Cuvier would have been the first to repudiate or ignore.
</p>

<p>
The ardent MacGillivray was naturally scornful of
Swainson's unscientific attitude, which he had roundly
scored in the introduction to his <i>History of British Birds</i>
that had begun to appear in 1837; he then said that
Swainson could exclaim: "How superficially do we
study nature," while in anatomy his own studies were
a century behind the times and his opinions on the
subject worthy of the Dark Ages.
</p>

<p>
In his biographical notice of Audubon, Swainson
refers to their Paris experience in the following words:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is singular how two minds, possessing the same tastes,
can be so diversified, as to differ <i>in toto</i> respecting the very
same objects. During the whole of Mr. Audubon's residence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
in Paris, he only visited the Ornithological Gallery twice,
(where I was studying for hours, almost daily), for the purpose
of calling upon me; and even then he merely bestowed that
sort of passing glance at the magnificent cases of birds, which
a careless observer would do while sauntering in the room.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon, to be sure, was never much of a closet naturalist
or an admirer of stuffed specimens; but in reading
this criticism of an estranged friend, one wonders
if the writer had really forgotten that while his own
expressed desire in going to Paris in 1828 was to study
in the Museum, Audubon's sole purpose was to extend
his subscription list; that after innumerable interviews
with ministers of state and running from post to pillar
for two months, his friend was obliged to come away
with but thirteen additional names or orders for his
work. Had Swainson also forgotten that during all
that time Audubon acted as his interpreter, assisting
him in all his visits and purchases, and that but shortly
after, when hard pressed for money, he had called on
Audubon for a considerable sum?
</p>

<p>
As a parting shot to his former friend, Swainson
also said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
He can shoot a bird, and make it live again, as it were,
upon canvass; but he cannot describe it in scientific, and therefore
in perfectly intelligible terms. Hence he found it necessary,
in this part of his work, to call in the aid of others; but
being jealous that any other name should appear on the title
page than his own, he was content with the assistance of some
one who, very good naturedly, would fall in with his humour.
</p>
</div>

<p>
What was here said of Audubon might have been
true in 1830, but it was not true in 1840. Swainson
could never understand that his friend was a man who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
never stood still. Audubon drew heavily upon his more
learned associates, and he could give as well as take.
When working under the influence of a powerful motive,
he improved as rapidly in his use of English words as
he had in the finish and composition of his pictures;
he soon came to write not only with fluency but at
times with eloquence, and the technicalities of his science
did not remain to him a sealed book, though for
the drudgery of detailed description he had confessedly

<p>
We have referred to William Swainson's advocacy
of the "Circular" or "Quinarian" system of the classification
of animals, with him amounting almost to a
monomania, which was one of the most notorious examples
of reasoning in a circle of which zoölogists have
ever been guilty. It was a serious attempt to rationalize
nature in a wholly irrational manner, and must be
regarded as a curious by-product of minds fixed in the
belief of a special creation,—to whom every form of
evolutionary doctrine was sacrilegious and abhorrent.
Its advocates, nevertheless, were sincere, and Swainson
probably regarded himself as a martyr to the cause. As
a later critic remarked, the system served him well by
investing with a cloak of originality his treatises on those
classes of animals with which he had little first-hand
knowledge. His work on fishes is regarded as "a literary
curiosity, the appearance of which was a misfortune
to a man who, by his indefatigable industry under
by no means favorable circumstances, had contributed
as much as any of his contemporaries to the advancement
of Zoölogy and its diffusion among the people."<a name='FA_109' id='FA_109' href='#FN_109' class='fnanchor'>[109]</a>
This egregious doctrine, which its disciples called "the
natural system" without grasping the true meaning of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
"affinity," or "homology," to use the more modern word,
vitiated most of their writings; abler men played with it
for a time, only to cast it aside, and no one but a historian
or a psychologist would now give it a passing thought.
</p>

<p>
So far as Swainson was concerned, Audubon's conduct
appears to have been above reproach, and it must
be regarded as fortunate that this ardent "Quinarian"
did not have a hand in the <i>Biography of Birds</i>, for if
it were really true that Audubon could have brought
himself to accept the artificial system then in vogue,
American ornithology, as Elliott Coues remarked, escaped
a great affliction.
</p>

<p>
Swainson's early life affords a striking illustration
of nepotism, and his later years reflected some of its disastrous
consequences. At fourteen he was appointed as
a junior clerk in the Liverpool Customs House at a
salary of eighty pounds a year, to service under his
father, who had in turn succeeded his grandfather in the
office of Collector. At eighteen he received an appointment
in the commissary department of the English army
and went to Sicily, where he remained eight years, during
which he worked industriously at natural-history
pursuits. Having attained the rank of Assistant Commissary-General,
at twenty-six he was retired on half-pay
because of ill health. Upon returning to England
he became a member of the Linnæan Society, in 1816,
before his departure for Brazil, where with Henry Koster
he collected birds for nearly two years. Having
settled again at Liverpool, he entered the Royal Society,
on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, in
1820, the year in which he began to publish the results
of his studies. Swainson was married in 1825, but upon
the death of his father in the following year, his income
so much reduced that he resorted to authorship as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
a profession; of course he found it a poor crutch, though
he worked with indefatigable industry and produced
from one to two illustrated volumes each year. Eventually
he became embittered against Audubon and towards
the world of men and things in general, especially after
1835, when domestic bereavement and trouble of many
kinds pressed hard upon him. He repeatedly applied
to the Zoölogical Department of the British Museum
for a position which went to others; he tried to sell his
collections to the Museum and failed; he applied for
an appointment on the Civil List but was denied; then
he decided to give up the struggle of authorship in England
and leave the country.
</p>

<p>
In 1840 Swainson emigrated with his family to New
Zealand, where he seems to have met with no better success,
although his scientific activity did not wholly cease.
Though four years younger than Audubon, he outlived
him five years, dying in 1856. His excellent draughtsmanship,
tireless industry, and punctilious habits were
deserving of recognition, but he suffered from the lack
of a liberal education, and was rather too vain, too inclined
to jealousy and to quarrel with his contemporaries,
to have achieved great success.

<p>
In a paragraph already quoted from the <i>Ornithological
Biography</i>, in which Audubon portrayed the
eagerness with which some naturalists pressed forward
to describe new species of birds, too often forgetting
every propriety in their eagerness to outstrip a rival, the
name of his "excellent friend, Charles Lucien Bonaparte,"<a name='FA_110' id='FA_110' href='#FN_110' class='fnanchor'>[110]</a>
had been indiscreetly mentioned. Though
there was no evident intention of giving offense, this
reference was keenly resented. Bonaparte, it may be
recalled, was still engaged upon his <i>American Ornithology</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
the last volume of which was not published
until 1833, and was therefore, in a degree, a rival of
Audubon in the ornithological field. Audubon did his
best to smooth over the difficulty but with little success.
In writing to his son, Victor, from New York in 1833,<a name='FA_111' id='FA_111' href='#FN_111' class='fnanchor'>[111]</a>
he referred to the following letter which he was about to
send "by duplicate, to try to correct that error" of his
early friend:

</p>

<p>
I am sadly grieved to hear through our friend, Wm. Cooper,
of this city, that you have taken umbrage to a passage in the
Introduction to my first volume of Ornithological Biographies.
</p>

<p>
To tell you that not even a thought of disparagement ever
existed in my mind towards you, would not be enough. I have
always repeated to all my Friends, nay, to all persons who
have ever spoken of you, of the superior talents you possess,
and of the Intrinsic value connected with all your ornithological
or otherwise scientific productions.
</p>

<p>
I am a plain sailing man. You know full well that I derive
no knowledge from classical education, and that being the
case, connected with my being honest, I always try to say what
I think truth, at once. Could I have praised you at one place,
and attempted to lower you in the estimation of the Scientific
World at another? If so—I would acknowledge myself unworthy
the good wishes of <i>any one</i>, much less of the good wishes
of Charles Bonaparte! the very being who brought me forward
into worldly notice by his kind advice. Nay, Nay; take me for
what I am in truth
</p>

<p>
Your Friend &amp; ever your well wisher, as well as your
obt. Sert.

<p>
Bonaparte was too much of a man of the world to
permit such an incident to cause any sudden break in
their relations. We know that they met in London in
1837, when, as Audubon said in a later letter to Harris<a name='FA_112' id='FA_112' href='#FN_112' class='fnanchor'>[112]</a>
he "pumped him sadly too much"; at his request
Bonaparte then drew up a list of American birds, to
the number of 425.<a name='FA_113' id='FA_113' href='#FN_113' class='fnanchor'>[113]</a> Although his subscription to <i>The
Birds of America</i> was permitted to lapse, Bonaparte's
name was retained on the list to the end. When the
business was being closed up in London, however, Audubon
wrote to Havell, from Edinburgh, under date
of 15 May, 1839: "As respects my <i>old</i> Friend, C. Bonaparte,
<i>unless</i> he pays the long standing balance which he
owes me of £8.18.6, and also the price of the set of Nos.
81-87, <i>on the nail</i>, he is not to receive the latter." Again
on the thirtieth of June he wrote: "I have no numbers
for Charles Bonaparte, and no 5th. vol. of Biog. for
Mr. Gould; let the Gentlemen purchase or procure what
they want where they can."
</p>

<p>
In 1838 Bonaparte published a paper<a name='FA_114' id='FA_114' href='#FN_114' class='fnanchor'>[114]</a> in which
appeared this comment:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Throughout the list I have quoted, as types of the species
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
under consideration, the figures of the great works of Mr.
John Gould and Mr. Audubon on the Ornithology of the two
regions, as they must be considered the standard works of the
subject. The merit of Mr. Audubon's work yields only to the
size of his book; while Mr. Gould's work on the <i>Birds of
Europe</i> though inferior in size to that of Mr. Audubon—is the
most beautiful work that has ever appeared in this or any
other country.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A reviewer in America,<a name='FA_115' id='FA_115' href='#FN_115' class='fnanchor'>[115]</a> who could not repress
his resentment at the last remark, said: "It would be
invidious to make any comment on this—to even insinuate
a wonder that a personage bearing this world
renowned name would consent to resign his reputation
as a man of science, through all time, to the doubtful
association of such an expression of mere professional
spite."
</p>

<p>
John Gould, to whom Bonaparte referred, was perhaps
the only ornithologist who ever grew rich at his
profession. He was the author of forty large, illustrated
folios, produced at the rate of about one a year, on
the birds of Great Britain, Europe, Asia, and Australia,
as well as those of numerous families of the tropical
Orient. Audubon, in response to Bachman, thus referred
to him when writing in London, April 30, 1835:
"Gould is a man of great industry and has the advantage
of the Zoölogical Society, museums, gardens, &amp;c.,
and is in correspondence with Temminck, Jardine,
Selby, James Wilson and the rest of the scientific
gentry. His wife makes his drawings on stone. She
is a plain, fine woman, and although their works are
not quite up to nature, both deserve great credit."
</p>

<p>
Acting no doubt upon this expressed belief, Audubon
became a subscriber to Gould's <i>Century of Birds</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
published in 1831, and also to his <i>Birds of Europe</i>
(1832-37). In the preface to the latter work, "J. J.
Audubon, Esq.," and twenty others are thanked "for
the warm interest which they have at all times taken in
the present work"; it was also said that the greater part
of the plates of this series, those of his <i>Century of Birds
from the Himalaya Mountains</i> and his <i>Monograph on
the Trogons</i>, as well as three-quarters of those of the
<i>Monograph on the Toucans</i>, "have been drawn and lithographed
by Mrs. Gould, from sketches and designs by
myself always taken from nature." It should be noticed
also that Gould appeared as a subscriber to <i>The
Birds of America</i> in 1838, but his name was soon
dropped.
</p>

<p>
Gould was preëminently a museum naturalist, of
strong commercial instincts, and spent but little time in
the field. His books were mainly composed of illustrations
made by artists from stuffed specimens, with a
text of so thin a quality as to possess little scientific
value; but, as Alfred Newton has remarked, a scientific
character was so adroitly assumed that scientific men
have often been deceived. In his best work, that on
the Humming Birds,<a name='FA_116' id='FA_116' href='#FN_116' class='fnanchor'>[116]</a> the plates are enlivened by numerous
specimens of tropical flowers and fruits, an accessory
not so noticeable in his early productions. It
has been said that Gould sought and received Audubon's
aid in the composition of some of his plates, and that
thereafter his figures began to show more vitality. The
over-zealous writer quoted above<a name='FA_117' id='FA_117' href='#FN_117' class='fnanchor'>[117]</a> made the charge that
Gould not only received much unacknowledged aid from
Audubon, but copied his drawings; he mentioned five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
cases of what he called "picking and stealing," in one of
which the Red-headed Pochard is declared to have been
copied from Audubon's Scaup Duck: "here the trick is
so shallow," he adds, "that detection cannot for a moment
be at fault. You see that the Scaup Ducks have
been accurately outlined, then lifted from the original
'grounding,' and let down upon a new one, by Gould,
who found it safer for his pencil to adjust earth and
water differently beneath them, than to tamper in the
slightest degree with the proportions of the figures themselves."
Suffice it to say that there is little or no substantial
basis for such odious charges.
</p>

<p>
Gould is said to have possessed a kind heart under
a rather gruff exterior. The following anecdote of his
methods comes at second hand from his friend and collaborator,
Mr. Bowlder Sharpe. Mr. Gould was invited
to dine at a well known country estate, where were gathered
numerous representatives of wealth and aristocracy.
The attention of the ornithologist was soon directed
from the guests to a bird on the lawn, which he was
watching intently when dinner was announced; abruptly
leaving the table with the remark that dinner was of
no consequence to him when he could study a bird, he
returned to the window and stood there munching a roll
or piece of bread. Of course the seated guests began
to inquire who the peculiar individual was, and were
quietly informed by their host that it was "Mr. Gould,
the famous ornithologist." The meal over, Gould selected
a promising looking young nobleman and began
to tell him about the habits of the bird which had so
fascinated him; "that species," he said, "I have described
in my <i>Birds of Europe</i>. Of course, you have seen my
<i>Birds of Europe</i>." The nobleman was obliged to admit
that he had not. "Why," said Mr. Gould, "you must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
have seen it; every country gentleman has it in his
library. Won't you let me put you down for a copy?"
Naturally he could not refuse a work which every country
gentleman possessed, and down went his name on
the list; later he received the volumes and also a bill
for fifty pounds. John Gould is said to have left a
fortune of eighty thousand pounds.
</p>

<p>
Probably no class of men with kindred tastes are
bound together with stronger ties of good fellowship
than the naturalists. Their free-masonry extends to
every clime and race, and knows no distinction of language,
class or station; but, as with all serious workers,
occasional jealousies or disputes occur to ruffle the serenity
of their lives. Though we have been obliged to
touch upon some of these incidents, they are nevertheless
quite exceptional.

<p>
Audubon's return voyage, begun in mid-April,
lasted twenty days, and was one of the uneventful, "not
unpleasant sort." Liverpool was reached in early May,
and later in the month the Audubons were again settled
in London, where on June 1, 1834, the naturalist wrote
to Edward Harris:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We found Victor at home in the evening of our arrival; I
thought that the very sight of him was a restoration of life to
me, and our happiness was as complete as it may ever be expected
on <i>this Earth</i>.
</p>

<p>
After all, I long to be in America again, nay, if I can go
home to return no more to Europe, it seems to me that I shall
ever enjoy more peace of mind, &amp; even Physical comfort than
I can meet with in any portion of the world beside.<a name='FA_118' id='FA_118' href='#FN_118' class='fnanchor'>[118]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
While at Charleston in the previous winter, Audubon
had worked diligently at his letterpress, and no
doubt, before returning to Europe had his "biographical"
materials well in hand. We have seen that at Edinburgh
in the autumn of 1830 he entered upon a businesslike
arrangement with William MacGillivray to assist
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
him with the technical portions of the <i>Ornithological
Biography</i>. The part which his young assistant played
in this work was long a subject of dispute, until letters
of both which showed the precise character of the relations
between them were finally published.
</p>

<p>
Immediately upon his return to England Audubon
again applied to his young friend, and received from
him the following letter:<a name='FA_119' id='FA_119' href='#FN_119' class='fnanchor'>[119]</a>

</p>
</div></div>
<p class="post">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
I am glad to hear of your safe arrival, which I did not
expect so soon, and pleased to find you in good health and
high spirits. As you have the kindness to inquire respecting
myself and family, I am happy to inform you that we are all
very well, contented and busy. My head and hands are quite
full—abundance of work and sufficient pay—time to ramble
now and then for the purpose of hammering rocks, pulling
plants, and shooting birds.
</p>

<p>
You say you have accumulated a mass of materials which
you are desirous of seeing in print, and propose that I should
revise it as before. I shall be glad to do so, if you please, and
willing that you confer the benefit on another, if you find it
expedient. As to the terms, let them be such as you please
with respect to money; but as time is valuable to me, I should
like that arrangements be made so as to prevent unnecessary
loss of it, by letting me have manuscripts, books, &amp;c. in due
array.
</p>

<p>
The skins of which you speak I apprehend cannot be disposed
of here to any great extent; but I believe shells might be
sold to advantage, and bring higher prices than in London.
</p>

<p>
You ask if I draw Birds yet, with a view to publish. My
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
answer is that I dissect, describe, and draw Birds, Quadrupeds,
whales, reptiles, and fishes, with view of astonishing the world,
and bettering my condition. I have about a hundred drawings,
all the size of life, excepting two dolphins. But I have determined
nothing as yet respecting publication. Some time ago
a friend of mine called on Mr. Havell with a letter in which I
desired that person to engrave for me a few of my drawings,
for the purpose of being exhibited at the meeting of naturalists.
I had no answer, and so Mr. Havell may go to Jerico,
or elsewhere, as he lists; but further your correspondent saith
not.
</p>

<p>
I am decidedly of opinion that, although you should continue
the publication of the Ornithological Biography, you
might bring out various other works which could not fail to
be popular; for example a biography of yourself, and sketches
of American scenery. But of these matters it is impossible to
speak to purpose unless I had the pleasure of seeing you, a
pleasure which I hope I shall have at the time of the general assembly
of the naturalists.
</p>

<p>
With best respects to Mrs. Audubon, and best wishes for
the prosperity of all that bear that name, I have the honour
to be, Dear Sir, yours in sincerity,

<p>
A satisfactory arrangement was made and MacGillivray
set to work on Audubon's second volume. On
the 16th of June he wrote from Edinburgh:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
If you send me twenty or twenty-five articles, I can revise
them without the books to which you refer, and without your
own presence, provided your descriptions be full, and the drawings
or plates sent to me. The skins and books might be consulted
afterwards, when we might go over the articles in company.
Should you come here for the purpose, it would not, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
believe, be necessary for you to stay more than three weeks or
so.... To be methodical I should like twenty-five birds, that
is description of birds, by your first parcel; but I cannot state
precisely at what time they might be revised, only I think were
you to send them, you might make a trip to France and be
back before I should be done.<a name='FA_120' id='FA_120' href='#FN_120' class='fnanchor'>[120]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
By the 9th of July MacGillivray had received the
twenty-five descriptions of birds called for, and on the
18th of that month he wrote to report progress as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I commenced my operations on the 1st of July, and have
transcribed and corrected eighteen articles, one <i>for</i> each day,
but not one <i>on</i> each, the work of Sunday being transferred to
Monday. This volume will certainly be much richer and more
interesting.... You wish to know my opinion as to the
improvement of your style. It seems to me to be much the
same as before, but the information which you give is more
diversified &amp; more satisfactory.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On more than one occasion MacGillivray urged Audubon
to reduce the size of his text, and in the letter
just quoted he said: "Had it been of the post 8vo size,
in two volumes it would have gone off in style; but
your imperial size and regal price do not answer for
radicals, or republicans either. Could you <i>sacrifice</i> the
first volume, reprint it of a small size and continue the
series to the end?" He remarked that if twenty woodcuts
or engravings were added to each volume, "it would
spread over the land like a flock of migratory pigeons.
Even without the embellishments it would fly, but were
you to give it those additional wings, it would sweep
along in beautiful curves, like the nighthawk or the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
purplebreasted swallow." "I have often thought," he
continued, "that your stories would sell very well by
themselves, and I am sure that with your celebrity,
knowledge, and enthusiasm, you have it in your power
to become more <i>popular</i> than your glorious pictures
can ever make you of themselves, they being too aristocratic
and exclusive."
</p>

<p>
Audubon kept MacGillivray supplied with materials,
while he remained in London during the summer of
1834. On the 25th of August he wrote Bachman that
he had sold bird skins to the British Museum to the
amount of fifty-two pounds sterling, and again for
twenty-five pounds, while Havell had disposed of a
goodly number more, so that "he would not be a loser
in that way"; he added: "My own double collection I
have in drawers at home." Acting evidently upon
Swainson's advice, Audubon began to accumulate a
large and valuable collection of the skins of American
birds, which he brought with him to America in 1839.<a name='FA_121' id='FA_121' href='#FN_121' class='fnanchor'>[121]</a>
Though rightly criticized for not having deposited in
some museum a complete series of the forms which he
described, Elliott Coues certainly was not justified in
remarking that his interest in a bird ceased from the
moment he had made a drawing of it; on the contrary,
he spent no end of time and lavished large sums of
money on collections to illustrate variation in every description,
as well as for anatomical dissection.
</p>

<p>
A hint thrown out by MacGillivray seems to have
been well taken, for in the letter just quoted Audubon
said: "This coming winter I will spend at writing my
<i>own</i> Biography, to be published as soon as possible, and
to be continued, as God may be pleased to grant me
life." As already noticed,<a name='FA_122' id='FA_122' href='#FN_122' class='fnanchor'>[122]</a> this effort resulted only in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
a fragmentary sketch, which was not published for over
half a century.
</p>

<p>
Audubon started for Edinburgh in September of
1834. He wrote to Edward Harris from Liverpool, on
the 15th of that month, to inquire into the truth of a
report, which had circulated in London, of the failure of
the house in New Orleans "in which our friend N. Berthoud
is concerned." "I wish you would have the kindness
to inform me," he adds, "if he is a sufferer by this
mishap, and I wish you to keep this quite <i>entre nous</i>."
</p>

<p>
At a slightly earlier day Audubon had entertained
the idea of illustrating the birds of Great Britain on a
scale commensurate with his work on those of America,
but on May 1, 1828, he wrote Swainson that no one
favored the project, and it was quickly given up. The
subject is referred to by MacGillivray, in a letter written
from Edinburgh, May 7, 1831: "As I understand
your proposals respecting the Birds of Britain to have
ended in nothing, and as you do not allude to the subject,
I shall suppose all your ideas to have dispersed,
and shall think of the matter myself." The first volume
of MacGillivray's <i>History of British Birds</i> appeared six
years later.<a name='FA_123' id='FA_123' href='#FN_123' class='fnanchor'>[123]</a> It is evident that he wished to obtain Audubon's
criticism of some of the drawings subsequently
used in this work when he sent the following formal
note<a name='FA_124' id='FA_124' href='#FN_124' class='fnanchor'>[124]</a> to his lodgings at Edinburgh:

you have depicted a whole class of the productions of your
native land, as evinced in the incomparable delineations of
your "Birds of America," renders your opinions respecting ornithological
drawings of the very highest authority; and I
have been anxious to submit my attempts to your decision,
which, if unfavourable, will induce me to remedy my defects,
or, if otherwise, will encourage me to proceed with an undertaking,
which by its arduousness and extent, is precisely suited
to my disposition. I shall therefore feel grateful for the expression
of your ideas respecting the Drawings, and I request
that should you favour me with it, you will not scruple to
censure freely, should you find occasion.

Audubon and MacGillivray finished their work in
November, and by the first of December the manuscript
of the second volume of the <i>Ornithological Biography</i>
was in the printer's hands. On the 10th of the latter
month Audubon wrote to Bachman from Edinburgh:
"I am quite sure I never have been half as anxious as I
am at this moment to do all in my power to <i>compleat</i>
my vast enterprise, and sorrowful indeed would be my
dying moments if this book of mine were not finished
ere my eyes are for ever closed." The naturalist was
thinking of materials for new "Episodes" for the work
when he added:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Try to study the habits of the alligator, the time of its
propagation, number of eggs, form of the nest, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. I

<p>
By now Docr. Parkman has at least a portion of the letter
press and I hope has begun printing the second vol. of
Biog. 750 copies for America, and the same number are printing
here. I wish you would cut out from all newspapers the
pros and cons about me.

We thus have from Audubon himself a definite statement
in regard to the publication of his <i>Biography</i>
of Birds in America, and as to the number of copies
issued.
</p>

<p>
MacGillivray immediately agreed to "revise and correct"

</p>
</div>

<p>
When William MacGillivray first met Audubon, in
the autumn of 1830, he was an enthusiastic naturalist
of four and thirty, young, but, as we have seen, a thorough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
anatomist, who stood firmly on his own feet and
was destined to advance his favorite study in a notable
degree. Audubon at this time was forty-five, but in
anatomy the older man gladly sat at the feet of the
younger and acknowledged him master; while this
young anatomist was dissecting, Audubon in the <i>rôle</i>
of student was seated by his side, and we may be sure
that little escaped his penetrating eye and keen intelligence.
To MacGillivray, on the other hand, Audubon
was master of his art, and to him he looked for criticism
of his own artistic efforts; after him he named a son,
and to him dedicated a child of his brain.<a name='FA_125' id='FA_125' href='#FN_125' class='fnanchor'>[125]</a> In short,
MacGillivray looked upon Audubon as his best friend
in the world, and the latter fully appreciated his indebtedness
to this able assistant. MacGillivray continued to
aid Audubon with his letterpress, revising and probably
contributing most of the technical details; in the fourth
and concluding volumes, published in 1838 and 1839,
the large store of anatomical matter and many excellent
drawings were duly acknowledged as coming from his
hand. His own writings were varied and numerous,
but were generally characterized by a high degree of
excellence. His <i>History of British Birds</i>, in five volumes
(1837-1852), was too extended and too technical
ever to become popular, but in that work, for the first
time in the history of science, classification was placed
on a strictly anatomical basis. MacGillivray even followed
Audubon to some extent by introducing into this
work "delineations of British scenery and character,"
but under another head. The sixth of his "Lessons in
Practical Ornithology" recounts in dialogue form the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
experiences of two friends in tramping the Pentland
Hills together; says "Physiophilus" [himself], "You
must have many fine songsters in America"; to which
"Ornithologus" [Audubon] replies:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
That we have indeed. The Mocking Bird, of course, stands
first in my opinion, and is unrivalled. Then, perhaps on account
of my own sensitive nature, I would place next the Wood
Thrush, although the Cat Bird is far its superior in many
points, as is also the Turdus rufus. Think of our Rose-breasted
Pine and Blue Grosbeaks, how mellow and sweet their continuous
songs are, whether by day or during calm nights. Watch
the varied ditties of the Orchard Oriole, and the loud and more
musical notes of its brother, the Golden Hangnest. You have
never heard the Tawny Thrush or the Hermit Thrush, otherwise,
believe me, you would have enjoyed much delicious
pleasure....
</p>
</div>

<p>
William MacGillivray was a man of the finest character
and an honor to the best traditions of British scholarship;
in his enthusiasm and indefatigable energy he
was fully a match to Audubon. For nearly twelve years
(1841-1852) he was an honored lecturer and professor
in Marischal College and University, Aberdeen, where
he died, probably as a result of overwork in the field, in
1852, thus outliving his older friend but one year. His
last completed work, <i>Natural History of Deeside and
Braemar</i>, was published under the patronage of Queen
Victoria and by her command privately printed, under
the editorship of E. Lancaster, in 1855. MacGillivray's
surviving son, whose career as a field naturalist was also
cut short by too strenuous work, accompanied Huxley,
then an assistant surgeon in the Royal Navy, on the
memorable voyage of the <i>Rattlesnake</i> under Captain
Owen Stanley in 1842. MacGillivray was honored when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
alive, and though dead has not been forgotten; in 1890
a beautiful tablet was dedicated to him in Aberdeen,
and at the same time a worthy monument was raised
to his memory at Edinburgh.<a name='FA_126' id='FA_126' href='#FN_126' class='fnanchor'>[126]</a>
</p>

<p>
In authorship the public is mainly interested in seeing
merit duly acknowledged. Said Audubon, in the
introductory address to his first volume:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There are persons whose desire of obtaining celebrity induces
them to suppress the knowledge of the assistance which
they have received in the composition of their works. In many
cases, in fact, the real author of the drawings or the descriptions
in books on Natural History is not so much as mentioned,
while the pretended author assumes to himself all the merit
which the world is willing to allow him. This want of candour
I could never endure. On the contrary, I feel pleasure in here
acknowledging the assistance which I have received from a
friend, Mr. William MacGillivray, who being possessed of a
liberal education and a strong taste for the study of the Natural
Sciences, has aided me, not in drawing the figures of my
Illustrations, nor in writing the book now in your hand, although
fully competent for both tasks, but in completing the
scientific details, and in smoothing down the asperities of my
Ornithological Biographies.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the introduction to Volume IV he added that the
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
anatomical descriptions, as well as the sketches by which they
are sometimes illustrated, have been executed by my learned
friend, William MacGillivray, who in the most agreeable manner
consented to undertake the labour, by no means small, of such a
task, and to whom those who are interested in the progress of
Ornithological science, as well as myself, must therefore feel
indebted.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
</p>

<p class="post">
Audubon evidently believed that this printed acknowledgment
was just; MacGillivray was as plainly satisfied,
so that complaints which have been made against the
naturalist on this score seem to have been rather groundless.
It might be noticed that bookmaking at that time
was regarded as more of a trade than at present; as
Sir Walter Besant remarks, a traveler would often give
his notes to a bookseller, who in turn would hand them
over to a literary hack to be cast into suitable form.

A fine token of the friendship which existed between
these two men was discovered in the summer of 1903 in
a London bookshop, where it was found reflected in the
pages of a handsomely bound copy of Audubon's <i>Biography
of Birds</i>; on the title pages were inscribed the
autographs of William MacGillivray, while on the first

Audubon had written this dedication:

Professor John Wilson gave the third volume of the
<i>Ornithological Biography</i> a very handsome notice in
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, and on New Year's Day, 1836,
Audubon acknowledged the compliment in the following

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>:—
</p>

<p>
The first hour of this new year was ushered to me surrounded
by my dear flock, all comfortably seated around a small
table in middle-sized room, where I sincerely wished you had
been also, to witness the flowing gladness of our senses, as from
one of us "Audubon's Ornithological Biography" was read from
your ever valuable Journal. I wished this because I felt assured
that your noble heart would have received our most grateful
thanks with pleasure, the instant our simple ideas had conveyed
to you the grant of happiness we experienced at your
hands. You were not with us, alas! but to make amends the
best way we could, all of a common accord drank to the health,
prosperity, and long life, of our generous, talented, and ever
kind friend, Professor John Wilson, and all those amiable beings
who cling around his heart! May those our sincerest wishes
reach you soon, and may they be sealed by Him who granted
us existence, and the joys heaped upon the "American woodsman"
and his family, in your hospitable land, and may we
deserve all the benefits we have received in your ever dear country,
although it may prove impossible to us to do more than
to be ever grateful to her worthy sons.
</p>

<p>
Accept our respectful united regards, and offer them to
your family, whilst I remain, with highest esteem, your truly
thankful friend and most obedient servant,

<p>
Wilson had said in his earlier review:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We do not believe that till within these few years, he had
any practice in composition.... Yet Genius, if from circumstances
behindhand in any common accomplishment, soon supplies
it—soon makes up its lee-way—or rather, it has only to
try to do what it has never done before, and it succeeds in it
to admiration. Audubon, who had written but little even in
his native tongue—French—under a powerful motive, took to
writing English; and he was not long in learning to write it
well, not only with fluency, but eloquence, as the fine extracts
we have quoted show in unfading colours.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The following comment on Audubon's second volume
of the <i>Biography</i> appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i> for
1835:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
If only considered as evidence that it is in the power of man
to achieve whatever he <i>wills</i>, and that no obstacles are too great
to be overcome by energy and devotion of purpose, it would
claim our good will and best wishes.
</p>

<p>
He has told what he has seen and undergone, not perhaps
in the smooth nicely balanced periods of a drawing-room writer
... but with unstudied freedom, rising at times to eloquence,
nor been ashamed to utter the thousand affectionate and benevolent
feelings which a close and enthusiastic communion with
nature must nourish. The work is full of the man.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The winter and spring of 1835 were spent in London,
and though suffering from the strain of overwork,
Audubon kept doggedly at his tasks. On April 20 he
wrote to Bachman:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Immediately on my arrival in London I set to writing, and
finished in one month, one 4th. of the Biographies of my 3d.
vol. This rendering me <i>puffy</i>, I could scarcely breathe—my
appetite was gone—my digestion bad—in other words I was
attacked by Dyspepsia as bad as ever. Then I thought of a
change of work—for in change of labour the body and the mind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
undergo sure and certain relief. I took to Drawing! and what
do you think—I have positively finished 33 drawings of American
birds in England. This has enabled me to swell my 3d. vol.
of Illustrations with 57 species not given by Wilson and therefore
forestalling my friend Charles Bonaparte.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the 28th of April Audubon wrote to Edward
Harris, begging him to send specimens of certain birds
which he needed, as well as a circumstantial account of
the shad fisheries of the Delaware River as material for
an "Episode" for the third volume of his <i>Biography</i>;
the fiftieth number of his illustrations was then in the
hands of the colorist. He continued:<a name='FA_128' id='FA_128' href='#FN_128' class='fnanchor'>[128]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I thought better to push my publication on account of the
woeful dulling of the times in this country, where political
strife engrosses the mind of every person so much that arts and
sciences are, as it were, put on the shelves. Ministers are beings
of six weeks lives now-a-days. The Reformers are struggling
against the Tories, and vice versa. The Churchmen are aghast
at the prospect of the future, and all this puts a complete stoppage
to business, independent of such matters. Even since my
return to England I have obtained only two or three subscribers,
and have lost more than a dozen; nay, I may safely say,
two dozen. In America, on the contrary, things appear to go
on more prosperously. May God's will grant a long continuation
of this to our <i>only Land</i> of Liberty. France, you will have
heard, has at last passed an order for the payment of her debts
to the citizens of the United States, and I hope that this may
prove amply sufficient to save us from having a war with that
powerful nation.... I wrote you that Dr. George Parkman,
of Boston, would have my 2d. volume of Biographies reprinted
in his city. I have seen 100 pages of this reprint here, but do
not know if the Vol. (American Ed.) has appeared before the
Public?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My—Friends—erton, Ord &amp; Co. keep up their curious
animadversions against me still—methinks they must be shockingly
mortified at my stubborn silence toward them. Some
unknown friends now &amp; then reply to their absurdities.
</p>
</div>

<p>
His persistent heckler, Charles Waterton, was quite
busy at this time, four articles having been directed
against Audubon or his friends in 1835, though this was
not his most prolific year. A similar reference occurs
in a letter written to Bachman from Edinburgh on the
20th of July: "As to the rage of Mr. Waterton, or the
lucubrations of Mr. Neal, who by the bye is a subscriber
to the Birds of America (bona fide), I really care not a
fig—all such stuffs will soon evaporate, being mere
smoke from a Dung Hill."
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1835 Audubon was again established
in Edinburgh and working with unremitting vigor
at his <i>Biography</i>; some idea of the speed which he maintained
when able to devote himself unreservedly to this
task can be gathered from the fact that after the issue
of his second volume, of 620 large pages, in December,
1834, the third, of 654 pages, was published in just a
year from that time. He wrote to Edward Harris from
Edinburgh on the 5th of July, when engaged in this
work:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I intend to write a few ["Episodes"] of such extraordinary
men, now deceased, with whom I have been acquainted—Thomas
Bewick, and Baron Cuvier, for example.
</p>

<p>
We receive no new subscribers in Europe. The taste is
passing for Birds like a flitting shadow—Insects, reptiles and
fishes are now the rage, and these fly, swim or crawl on pages
innumerable in every Bookseller's window. When this is also
passed, naturalists will have to turn over a new leaf and commence
afresh, or go to the antipodes in search of materials to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
please the taste for novelty's sake.—However my work will I
hope be finished ere I leave this world, and must be appreciated
in years to come, when perhaps my childrens' children will feel
proud of their gone ancestor, "The American Woodsman."
You see my Dear Friend how far enthusiasm and a portion of
the like for standing fame carries even your humble servant a
man with no other means than his industry and prudence as a
means of support, and one with scarce the motive of education.
There are moments, and they are not far between, when thinking
of my present enormous undertaking, I wonder how I have been
able to support the extraordinary amount of monies paid for
the work alone, without taking cognizance of my family and my
expeditions, which ever and anon travelling as we are from place
to place and country to country are also very great. When
I publish my Life and let the world know that Audubon like
Wilson, was at Phila. without the half of a Dollar, and that
had it not been for benevolent generosity of a certain Gentleman
whose name is Edward Harris, Audubon must have walked off
from one of the fairest of our Cities like a beggar does in poor
Ireland, left destitute of all things save his humble talents, and
his determination to produce something worthy of the soul of
man: I say my dear Harris will not the world stare! Poor
Wilson was only better off than I on account of his superior
talents over me at driving the goose quill, but much similarity
still seems to have [existed] in both of us, as I could drive the
pencil, the brush, the Fiddle bow and even the "Fleuret"
[better] than he.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon wrote to Harris again from Edinburgh,
on September 5, when he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Between you and I the measurements of different Birds given
by Wilson are hardly to be depended upon, as I constantly
discover a great deficiency in this part of his descriptions which
indeed in some cases are otherwise slack, and given as if when
fatigued or vexed. Nay I even think at times that he has
copied <i>Authors</i> and not nature? as in the instance of the Oyster
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
Catcher, which I fear he made &amp; figured from a European one
in the Philadelphia museum, took the descriptions from <i>Latham</i>,
and described the Habits of Palliartus which is our own Bird
and it seems the only species to be met with in America, at least
on our Atlantic coast. Wilson committed the same blunder with
the Rallus elegans which he <i>figured</i> and described the habits of
the R. capitans for it! I could enumerate more instances of
carelessness, but poor Wilson is dead and may God bless his
soul!
</p>

The third volume of his letterpress,<a name='FA_129' id='FA_129' href='#FN_129' class='fnanchor'>[129]</a> which dealt
with the water birds of America, made its appearance
at the close of 1835; in the introduction he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I look forward to the summer of 1838 with an anxious hope
that I may then be able to present you with the last plate of my
Illustrations, and the concluding volume of my Biographies.
To render these volumes as complete as possible, I intend to
undertake a journey to the southern and western limits of the
Union, with the view of obtaining a more accurate knowledge
of the birds of those remote and scarcely inhabited regions. On
this tour I shall be accompanied by my youngest son, while
the rest of my family will remain in Britain to direct the progress
of my publication.

Audubon returned to London with his family early
in 1836, visiting Newcastle, York, Leeds, Manchester
and Sheffield by the way, and took a house at Number 4,
Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square. As Mrs. Audubon's
health was anything but good, they were fortunate
in having as a neighbor in this street an eminent surgeon,
Benjamin Phillips,<a name='FA_130' id='FA_130' href='#FN_130' class='fnanchor'>[130]</a> and this friend was also a subscriber
to <i>The Birds of America</i>. "Were I to mention,"
said Audubon,

</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
the many occasions on which he has aided me by his advice and
superior knowledge of the world, you would be pleased to find
so much disinterestedness in human nature. His professional
aid too, valuable as it has proved to us, and productive of much
inconvenience to him, has been rendered without reward, for I
could never succeed in inducing him to consider us his patients,
although for upwards of two years he never passed a day without
seeing my wife.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the spring of 1836 Audubon's two sons made a
tour of France and Italy; on the 9th of March he wrote
to Harris that they expected to leave England in a week,
be gone three and a half months, visit Paris, Rome
and Messina, and return by way of Marseilles and Paris.
With the passage of 1836 he had completed 70 numbers,
of 350 plates, of his larger work, leaving but 85 plates
yet to be engraved. Though anxious to see this greatest
of his tasks brought to an end, he still looked with longing
eyes to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast,
and began preparations for his last journey to obtain
materials and subscribers in the United States.

Audubon left London with his son, John, July 30,
1836, and on the second day of August sailed from
Portsmouth on the packet <i>Gladiator</i>, bound for New
York. Two hundred and sixty live birds had preceded
them to the ship, while three dogs came as a present
from the Earl of Derby, and "a brace of tailless cats
from our friend George Thackeray, D.D., provost of
King's College": all had suffered somewhat from lack
of care, but the dogs, one of which was sent to John
Bachman of Charleston, and some of the birds crossed
the Atlantic in safety. Five weeks were spent at sea;
when the Navesink Highlands at last hove into view
the welcome news spread rapidly over the ship; rockets
were sent up later to attract a pilot, and when anchor
was grounded on American soil, Audubon confessed
that he cried like a child and devoutly thanked God
for their preservation. He continued:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
All was now bustle and mutual congratulations; our commander
was praised for his skill by some, and others praised his
whisky, which the waiters handed about, and the night was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
nearly spent in revelry; but John and myself retired at two
o'clock.... As a gleam of daylight appeared, my eyes
searched through the hazy atmosphere to catch a glimpse of
the land, and gradually Staten Island opened to my view; then
the boat of the custom-house appeared, and soon he boarded
us, arranged the sailors and passengers on deck, and called
their names. Then followed breakfast, and soon another boat,
with a yellow flag flying, landed the health officer, and there
being no sickness on board, myself and John returned to Staten
Island in the doctor's boat, and were taken by the steamer
Hercules to the city.<a name='FA_131' id='FA_131' href='#FN_131' class='fnanchor'>[131]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon remained in New York from the 7th to
the 13th of September. On Sunday, the 12th, he wrote
to Edward Harris, in part as follows:<a name='FA_132' id='FA_132' href='#FN_132' class='fnanchor'>[132]</a>
</p>

<h4>
<i>Audubon to Edward Harris</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>—
</p>

<p>
... Whilst running over the interesting list of the Species
of Birds procured by Nuttall &amp; Townsend in the Rocky Mountains,
and the shores of the Pacific, I became so completely
wrapt up with the desire to see these as soon as possible that I
have concluded to go to Philadelphia tomorrow by the 10
o'clock boat. I will stay at Harlan's for two or three days and
hope that you will meet me there, that I may have the pleasure
of pressing your hand and talking to you.
</p>

<p>
You well know how anxious I am to make my work on the
Birds of our Country as compleat as possible within my power:—you
know that to reach this end I have spared neither time,
labours or money: you are also aware that although this undertaking
may never remunerate me, I am so enthusiastic as to
indulge in the hope that God will grant me life to effect all this;
but I am becoming old, and though very willing doubt whether
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
I could support the fatigues connected with a journey of several
years, and separated from my dear Family. Well the
desiderata has come to Philadelphia at least in part, and if I
could be allowed to pourtray the new species now there as an
appendix to the Birds of America, I should be proud and happy
to do so, but do you think that the Academy is likely to indulge
me in this my wish? Do join me at Harlan's as soon as you
can, and lend me a hand and try to promote my views through
mutual Friends attatched to that Institution.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon also communicated at once with John
Bachman, whom he had planned to visit on his journey
south, but soon learned that the cholera had broken out
in Charleston and that the Seminoles were on the warpath
in Florida. Said Bachman, writing on September
14:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
With regard to Florida, nothing will be done by naturalists
for at least two years. Your Indian friends, the cut-throats,
have scalped almost every woman and child south of St. Augustine,
save those on Key West. They have burnt and plundered
every plantation; and although they will probably be, in a
great measure, put down next winter, yet there will, undoubtedly,
remain many small predatory bands that will make no
bones of scalping at Ornithologist <i>secundum artem</i>; and would
ask no questions whether he were the friend or enemy of William
Penn. Of Texas, I think better, and thither, or along its borders,
you may, I think, venture—for the Texans are our friends.
I suppose Genl. Gaines will keep the Comanches quiet.<a name='FA_133' id='FA_133' href='#FN_133' class='fnanchor'>[133]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Bachman kept his friends informed of the progress
of the epidemic, which had placed an embargo over his
city; at the same time he sent news of the Anhingas,
Caracara Eagles and Cormorants, which had been successfully
held in captivity for the naturalist, and added:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
"These are awful times in money matters, but of this
you will hear enough when we meet. Everyone nearly
has failed, but the Parsons and Ornithologists."
</p>

<p>
On September 13 Audubon started for Philadelphia,
anxious to see with his own eyes those western collections
which had so stirred his curiosity. It seems that
in 1834, Dr. Thomas Nuttall and Dr. John Kirk Townsend
set out on a journey to the mouth of the Columbia
River; Nuttall was first of all a botanist, and is said to
have carried no gun, but Townsend was an experienced
ornithologist and made extensive collections of birds, a
part of which he sent in care of Nuttall to Philadelphia
in 1835, although he himself did not return east until
the close of 1837. One of Audubon's great ambitions
had been to explore the regions which they had recently
visited, and in the circumstances we can sympathize
with his desire to acquire so valuable an acquisition
for the work upon which he had been long engaged. The
object of his immediate quest apparently had been entrusted
to the Academy of Natural Sciences, an institution
which had not always shown itself friendly to his
claims, and which in this instance is said to have assisted
the travelers with funds to prosecute their journey.
The collection, said Audubon, contained "about forty
new species of birds, and its value cannot be described."
Balked in his initial efforts to obtain the coveted prize,
after two days of fruitless efforts on the part of his
Philadelphia friends, he returned to New York; Edward
Harris then came forward with the offer of $500
for the purchase of the collection outright, but negotiations
were not immediately successful.
</p>

<p>
With his hunger still unappeased, Audubon now
visited Boston on a canvassing tour, while his son remained
with Nicholas Berthoud at New York. Setting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
out on the 20th of September, he traveled by the steamer
<i>Massachusetts</i> and the Providence Railroad, paying
seven dollars fare, "which included supper and breakfast";
the sail up Providence Bay in early morning
was like a "fairy dream," and the locomotive in waiting
then pulled the passengers from "Providence to Boston
at the rate of fifteen miles an hour." We arrived, said
he, at four in the afternoon: "a cart took my trunk,
and placing myself by the side of the owner, we drove
to the house of my friend, Dr. George C. Shattuck."
</p>

<p>
On the day after his arrival, Audubon visited Thomas
M. Brewer, then a young ornithologist living at Roxbury,
to examine his collection of bird skins and eggs,
and upon his return called on David Eckley, "the great
salmon fisher," to whom he later presented a copy of his
folio plates of <i>The Birds of America</i>.<a name='FA_134' id='FA_134' href='#FN_134' class='fnanchor'>[134]</a> Brewer, who
later became a physician and distinguished ornithologist,
for many years was one of Audubon's valued correspondents
and supplied him with much interesting
material. On the following day Audubon met Thomas
Nuttall,<a name='FA_135' id='FA_135' href='#FN_135' class='fnanchor'>[135]</a> who at once promised him duplicates of all the
new birds which he had brought from the West. Colonel
Thomas H. Perkins, an early subscriber, Edward Everett,
who had befriended him in Washington, and who in
1836 became Governor of Massachusetts, Josiah Quincy,
president of Harvard College, Dr. Bowditch, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
other prominent characters, all extended a helping
hand. He visited Salem to deliver his letters, and was
successful in obtaining a number of subscribers; upon
invitation of the curator of the Natural History Society
there, he examined "the young collection of that newborn
institution," and had "the good fortune to find one
egg of the American bittern." On the 25th of September
he wrote Harris: "Nuttall has arrived—he breakfasted
with me the other day—gave me 6 new species
of Birds and tells me that he will urge both Townsend
and the Society at Philadelphia to allow me to portray
all the species which they have procured within the
limits of our Territories."
</p>

<p>
In Boston, September 27, 1836, Audubon made this
note in his journal:<a name='FA_136' id='FA_136' href='#FN_136' class='fnanchor'>[136]</a> "The citizens are all excitement;
guns are firing, flags flying, and troops parading and
John Quincy Adams is delivering a eulogy on the late
President Madison. The mayor of Boston did me the
honor to invite me to join in the procession, but I am
no politician and declined." He noted on the same day
also that Dr. Shattuck had completed the subscription
list of the Boston Society of Natural History "by presenting
me to his lady, who subscribed for one-tenth,
and the Dr. then put down his son George's name for
one-twentieth, making his own family one-fourth of the
whole, or two hundred and twenty dollars, for which
he gave me his cheque. Without the assistance of this
generous man, it is more than probable that the Society
never would have had a copy of 'The Birds of
America.'" Two days later he met Daniel Webster at
the rooms of the Historical Society, and on the same
evening at the home of Isaac P. Davis, where, said Audubon,
"we took tea, talked on ornithology and ornithologists;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
he promised to send me some specimens of
birds, and finished by subscribing to my work." Webster
also gave him a general note of recommendation,
in which he said:<a name='FA_137' id='FA_137' href='#FN_137' class='fnanchor'>[137]</a> "I take this mode of commending
Mr. Audubon to any friends of mine he may meet in his
journey to the west. I have not only great respect for
Mr. Audubon's scientific pursuits, but entertain for him
personally much esteem and hearty good wishes." Mr.
Davis exerted his influence in other directions, and in
this instance acted as agent for the transmission of
Audubon's plates to their distinguished friend; on October
7, he wrote:<a name='FA_138' id='FA_138' href='#FN_138' class='fnanchor'>[138]</a> "I received the half Nos of the
'Birds of America' for the worthy and sublime Danl.
Webster—they shall be delivered safely on his return."
After urging Audubon to visit Buffalo, where Dr.
Bowditch and his friends thought that a number of new
subscribers might be procured, he appended a list of
twelve likely names of residents of that city, and added:
"Bowdoin College shall be remembered as the opportunity
offers."
</p>

<p>
Webster, who was an ardent sportsman and well acquainted
with the water fowl of the coast, had volunteered
to procure for Audubon specimens of the Labrador
Duck, which was even then extremely rare and has
since become extinct, but was unable to fulfill his promise.
Audubon had already found that many American
birds, like the common crow, which had been regarded
as identical with those of the Old World, were in reality
distinct, and was now anxious, as he wrote to Thomas
Brewer, "to compare the anatomy of all our birds
with those of the same families in Europe." His letters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
to young Brewer at this time show how eager he was
to secure the promised specimens. On October 23 he
wrote from Philadelphia: "I hope you will not forget to
call on our enlightened statesman D. Webster, and remind
him of his kind promise to assist you in the procuring
of specimens for me. This winter and next
spring are my only chances, and I beg you to do all you
can for me." He wrote again from Charleston, January
1, 1837: "I am sorry that the Hon. D. Webster
has not attended to his promises, and will write to him;
yet I would beg you, being on the spot, <i>to trouble him a
good deal</i>."<a name='FA_139' id='FA_139' href='#FN_139' class='fnanchor'>[139]</a>
</p>

<p>
After returning to New York, Audubon had a visitor
for whom he expressed the greatest admiration,
Washington Irving, who had aided him in 1833; he now
received from his hands letters to Martin Van Buren,
the President-elect, and Benjamin F. Butler, who then
occupied the post of Attorney-General. Irving called
attention in his letter to the national character of Audubon's
work, and warmly commended it to the patronage
of the country at large. On October 8 Audubon
wrote MacGillivray from New York that he had obtained
twelve new subscribers, two at Salem, four at
Boston, and six in New York, but a little later, through
the aid of Nicholas Berthoud, in one week's time
eighteen new names were added to his subscription list
in New York City alone.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Nuttall's and Townsend's birds had not
been forgotten, and on October 15 he started with his
son for Philadelphia, where he was again welcomed by
Dr. Richard Harlan. No sooner, however, were efforts
renewed to gain permission to study the desired objects
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
than new obstacles were encountered. To quote the naturalist:<a name='FA_140' id='FA_140' href='#FN_140' class='fnanchor'>[140]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Having obtained access to the collection sent by Dr. Townsend,
I turned over and over the new and rare species, but he
was absent at Fort Vancouver, on the shores of the Columbia
River; Thomas Nuttall had not yet come from Boston, and loud
murmurs were uttered by the <i>soi-disant</i> friends of science, who
objected to my seeing, much less portraying and describing,
those valuable relics of birds, many of which had not yet been
introduced into our Fauna.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At length, "it was agreed," to continue his account of
the transaction,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
that I might <i>purchase duplicates, provided</i> the specific names
agreed upon by Mr. Nuttall and myself were published in Dr.
Townsend's name. This latter part of the affair was perfectly
agreeable to my feelings, as I have seldom cared much about
priority in the naming of species. I therefore paid for the
skins which I received, and have now published such as proved
to be new, according to my promise. But, let me assure you,
Reader, that seldom, if ever in my life, have I felt more disgusted
with the conduct of any opponents of mine, than I was
with the unfriendly boasters of their zeal for the advancement
of ornithological science, who at that time existed in the fair
city of Philadelphia.
</p>
</div>

<p>
While still in Philadelphia, on October 23, Audubon
wrote to Thomas Brewer that Dr. Morton, the corresponding
secretary of the Academy, had not only permitted
him to portray the new birds but had sold him
"ninety odd of the skins, forming a portion of the collection,"
and added that with his other acquisitions they
would swell his "catalogue to the number of 475, all of
which must be introduced in my fourth volume."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For many years Audubon had expressed great contempt
for all seekers after priority in the naming of
new species of animals, but now he began to find the
pressure from without too strong to be resisted. Rivalry
in this field had become keen on both sides of the Atlantic,
and in the commendable desire to render his work
as complete as possible, he was inevitably drawn into a
struggle in which the higher aspirations of scientific men
are all too apt to be obscured by petty vanities, suspicions
and disputes.
</p>

<p>
While at Philadelphia Audubon paid this fine tribute
to the ornithologist whom he had met at Louisville
twenty-six years before, and whose name had long been
a cover for the jealousies and animosities of supposititious
friends: "Passed poor Alexander Wilson's schoolhouse,
and heaved a sigh. Alas, poor Wilson! Would
that I could once more speak to thee, and listen to thy
voice!"
</p>

<p>
Audubon was planning during the coming year to
explore the west coast of Florida, in company with his
son and Edward Harris, and to proceed as far as possible
along the coast of Texas. From Philadelphia he
went to Baltimore, and on November 8 he arrived at
Washington. His steadfast friend and supporter,
Colonel John James Abert, then at the head of the
Topographical Bureau, took him to the White House
to call on President Andrew Jackson and present his
letters. The General, said Audubon, looked well and
was smoking a pipe; after reading his letters attentively,
he said at once: "Mr. Audubon, I will do all in my
power to serve you, but the Seminole war, will, I fear,
prevent you from having a cutter; however, as we shall
have a committee at twelve o'clock, we will consider
this, and give you an answer tomorrow." Levi Woodbury,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
Secretary of the Treasury, was as friendly as ever,
and offered the party passage to Charleston on the
<i>Campbell</i>, a vessel of fifty-five tons carrying three guns
and twenty-one men, but Audubon, who was a poor
sailor, preferred to travel by land and await the coming
of this boat at the Bachman home. Before leaving
the capital the naturalist and his son were invited to
dine informally at the White House, and he had the
opportunity of studying at close range "a man who had
done much good and much evil to our country." Said
Audubon of this dinner:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I sat close to him; we spoke of olden times, and touched
slightly on politics, and I found him very averse to the cause of
the Texans.... The dinner was what might be called plain
and substantial in England; I dined from a fine young turkey,
shot within twenty miles of Washington. The general drank
no wine, but his health was drunk by us more than once; and
he ate very moderately, his last dish consisting of bread and
milk.<a name='FA_141' id='FA_141' href='#FN_141' class='fnanchor'>[141]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon, with his son, John, left Washington on
the 10th of November, and after traveling six days on
one of "the most extraordinary railroads in the world,"
they reached the city of Charleston, where, under the
hospitable roof of John Bachman, the party eventually
passed the winter, though momentarily expecting their
vessel, which did not arrive. During this long interval
of waiting, Audubon made drawings of all the new birds
in the Nuttall-Townsend collection, representing upwards
of seventy figures, and Miss Maria Martin, Bachman's
sister-in-law, again assisted him in drawing
plants and insects.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As spring approached and the long awaited <i>Campbell</i>
had not arrived, Audubon, with Harris and John,
started overland for New Orleans. After several days
of hard traveling by coaches they reached Montgomery,
and descended the Alabama River by steamboat to
Mobile. When that district had been ransacked for
birds, they went on to Pensacola, where they learned
that the Government cutter would soon be at their
service at New Orleans; accordingly they retraced their
steps to Mobile, passed through the lakes, and entered
the southern capital, the city in which the naturalist
had nearly starved, a penniless stranger, sixteen years
before, but which, less than three-quarters of a century
later, was to raise a monument to his memory. He
was still destined to a degree of disappointment, when
it was learned that the <i>Campbell</i> could not be put in
readiness before the last of March, but he was delighted
to find that the old pilot of the <i>Marion</i>, Napoleon Coste,
was to command this vessel. At New Orleans Audubon
met for the last time "good M. Le Sueur," artist and
naturalist, who had spent many years at New Harmony,
Indiana, and whose acquaintance he had first
made at Philadelphia in 1824.
</p>

<p>
Audubon and his party finally left New Orleans
on the 1st of April and entered the Gulf by the Southwest
Pass, where, on the 3rd of the month, they were
joined by the <i>Crusader</i>, a schooner of twelve tons which
was attached to the Revenue Service; on this journey
she carried a crew of four, with as many guns, and
acted as a tender to the larger vessel. The expedition
was provisioned for two months, and aimed to explore
the keys, bayous and shoreline from the Mississippi to
the Bay of Galveston. Some of Audubon's experiences
on this cruise were described in a letter to William MacGillivray,<a name='FA_142' id='FA_142' href='#FN_142' class='fnanchor'>[142]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
dated "Côte Blanche, 18 April, 1837,"
which we will now reproduce:
</p>

<h4>
<i>Audubon to William MacGillivray</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,—
</p>

<p>
Being just now snugly anchored in a bay, the description
of which may prove agreeable to you, I sit down to give you
an account of what I have been doing since I last wrote to you.
</p>

<p>
After visiting "Rabbit Island," on which, as I have already
told you, not a single Rabbit or Hare is to be seen, we made our
way between it and Frisky Point, by a narrow and somewhat
difficult channel leading to the bay in which I now write. The
shores around us are entirely formed of a bank, from twenty
to thirty feet high, and composed of concrete shells of various
kinds, among which the Common Oyster, however, predominates.
This bank, which at present looks as if bleached by the sunshine
and rain of centuries, is so white that it well might form a
guiding line to the vessels which navigate this bay even in the
darkest nights. The bay, however, is so shallow, that it is
rarely entered by vessels larger than schooners of about seventy
tons burthen, which visit its shores to take in the sugars and
cottons grown in the neighbouring country.
</p>

<p>
The "Crusader" is a somewhat curious craft, small, snug
withal, and considerably roguish looking. She has not fewer
than four "grunters" on her fore deck, her sails are of pure
white cotton, and although she bears the lively flag of our
country at the peak, her being painted purely black gives her
the aspect, not merely of a smuggler, but of a pirate. But
here she is, at the entrance of a canal of a sugar plantation,
and close to another craft, much the worse for wear, and, for
aught I know to the contrary, belonging to the captain alone,
who, I would almost venture to assert, belongs to no country
at all.

It is now four weeks since a razor came in contact with my
chin. All my companions are equally hircine; or, if you please,
hirsute. As to our clothing, were you to see us at this moment,
you would be ready to exclaim, "What vagabonds these fellows
are!" Coats and trousers plastered with mire, shirts no longer
white, guns exhibiting the appearance of being in constant use,
and all sorts of accoutrements that pertain to determined
hunters, complete our <i>tout ensemble</i>. But, as I have said, here
we are, and on shore must go. "Man the gig," quoth our captain.
In a trice the gig is manned. One after another, for
there are five or six of us, we swing ourselves into the after-sheets.
The word is given, the oars are plied, and now we are
once more on terra firma.
</p>

<p>
The crossing of large bays, cumbered with shallow bars and
banks of oyster-shells, is always to me extremely disagreeable,
and more especially when all these bars and banks do not contain
a single living specimen of that most delectable shell-fish.
Nay, I am assured by our pilot, who is no youngster, that ever
since he first visited this extensive waste, not an oyster has been
procured in these parts. But now, in single file, like culprits or
hungry travellers, we proceed along the margin of the canal.
Ah, my dear friend, would that you were here just now to see
the Snipes innumerable, the Blackbirds, the Gallinules, and the
Curlews that surround us;—that you could listen as I now do,
to the delightful notes of the Mocking-bird, pouring forth his
soul in melody as the glorious orb of day is fast descending
towards the western horizon;—that you could watch the light
gambols of the Night Hawk, or gaze on the Great Herons
which, after spreading their broad wings, croak aloud as if
doubtful regarding the purpose of our visit to these shores!
Ah! how well do I know you would enjoy all this; but, alas! we
are more than four thousand miles apart.
</p>

<p>
Hark! what's that? Nothing but a parcel of men coming
to greet us. Here they are, seven or eight Negroes. Who lives
here my good fellows? Major Gordy, massa. Well, now show
us the way to the house. Yes, gentlemen, come along. So we
follow our swarthy guides.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The plantations here are of great value, both on account
of their proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, and the excellence of
the soil, which, as in other parts of Louisiana, is composed of a
fat, black mould. The Indian corn was at least six feet high,
and looked most beautiful. As we approached the mansion of
Major Gordy, I observed that it has a pleasant aspect, and was
furnished with a fine garden, and a yard well stocked with cattle,
together with a good number of horses and mules, just let loose
from labour. A mill for grinding corn and making sugar particularly
drew our notice to it, as the Crusader happened just
then to be destitute of both articles; and as I saw some women
milking the cows, my heart fairly leaped with joy, and the
hope that ere long we might procure a full bowl of the delightful
and salubrious beverage. The short twilight of our southern
latitudes had now almost involved every object in that dim
obscurity so congenial to most living creatures after the toils
of the day, as allowing them to enjoy that placid quiet which
is required to restore their faded energies.
</p>

<p>
Near the entrance of the mansion stood an elderly man, of
tall stature and firm aspect, leaning on what I would call a
desperate long gun. As I approached this Côte Blanche
planter, I thought that something not so very friendly as I
could have wished was expressed in his countenance. As he
rested his heavy frame on his monstrous rifle, he neither moved
his head, nor held out his hand to me, until I presented mine to
him, saying, "My good sir, how do you do?" His answer was a
rather suspicious look at me and my companions; but notwithstanding,
and probably because he was on his own ground,
he asked us what was our wish, and then desired us to
walk in.
</p>

<p>
Côte Blanche Bay, you must be informed, has for a number
of years been infested by a set of rascally piratical vagabonds,
who have committed extensive depredations, in consequence
of which, a few years ago, a United States' revenue cutter
was sent to protect the coast. I have no doubt that the major
took us, to a man, for members of the gang who had more
than once visited, not his house, but his plantation, on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
which they had played many wanton and atrocious freaks.
</p>

<p>
We now, however, had entered the house. Candles were
lighted, and we at once came face to face, as it were. It curiously
happened that our captain was without his uniform, and
fully as rough looking otherwise as any of us. I was, however,
much pleased to see that the major himself was not much superior
to us in respect of apparel; nor had his razor been employed
for many days. I happened to have about me some
unequivocal credentials, from the head departments of the
United States, which, on my observing that some degree of
suspicion still remained, I placed in his hands. He read them,
spoke kindly to us, promised to forward our letters to the nearest
post-town, and invited us to consider his dwelling as our
own. From that moment until we returned to our vessel, we
were all as comfortable and merry as men can be when distant
from their own dear homes.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we received from Major Gordy a barrel of
sugar, another of corn meal, some pails of milk, and a quantity
of newly made butter, together with potatoes and other needful
articles—and all this without being allowed so much as to offer
him the least recompense. The day after, we returned to breakfast
by invitation, and found in the house several strangers
armed with rifles and double-barrelled guns. After we had
been introduced to all around, we seated ourselves, and made a
vigorous attack upon our host's eggs and bacon, coffee, tea, and
milk. As this important business was proceeding, I was delighted
to hear the following anecdotes, which I hope you, my
dear friend, will relish as much as I did.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said our host, straightening himself up in his
chair, "I am considerably suspicious as regards the strangers
who happen to anchor within the range of my dominions. Indeed,
gentlemen, I must acknowledge that even after you returned
on board last night, I sent off some of my men in various
directions, to let my neighbours know that a strange craft had
anchored near the landing-place; and here, gentlemen, are those
neighbours of mine; but as it happens that the name of the
gentleman who calls himself a 'Naturalist' is well known to some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
of them, I now feel quite satisfied as respects the purposes you
have in view. But let me tell you what happened to me some
years ago.
</p>

<p>
"Such a shark-looking craft as the one you call the Crusader
happened to drop its anchor abreast of my landing-place,
about dusk one evening, and as I guessed that the fellows on
board were not better than they should be, I watched their
motions for a while from my back piazza. But nothing happened
that night. Next morning, however, I heard the firing
of guns down the meadows where my cattle and hogs were in
the habit of feeding. So I took my rifle, walked towards the
spot, and soon found, sure enough, that the rascals had killed a
fine ox and several hogs, which they were dragging to the shore.
Indeed, gentlemen, I saw the yawl crammed with the spoils of
my plantation. Well, I took as good an aim as I could at the
nearest man, and cracked away, but without hitting. At the
report of my gun the fellows all took to their heels, and getting
on board hoisted sail and went off. I have never heard of
them since. Well, gentlemen, about the same hour next morning,
a black-looking barge, hardly as large as your Crusader,
came to, off the very same spot, and although I watched it and
every one on board nearly the whole night, and it was a beautiful
moon-shining one, not a soul of them came on shore until
morning. Then, however, I saw some bustle on board. Several
men got off in a very small affair, which was fastened astern
of the large boat. I saw them land, and deliberately walk
towards the meadows. No sooner had they reached the
wettest part, and that is where my hogs generally root for
food, than crack, crack, crack, went off their guns in all directions.
You may well suppose how vexed I was at all this, and
conceive how soon I mustered my men with clubs, and armed
myself with my rifle. On reaching the ground, think, gentlemen,
what were my thoughts, when I saw the fellows all advancing
towards me and my people, as if they were the honestest men
in the world. I was so mad when they came close up, that I
had a mind to shoot the one in front, for he looked for all the
world as if he cared not a pin for any one. However, I did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
not shoot, but asked him why he was shooting my hogs? 'Hogs!
good man, you are quite mistaken; we are shooting snipes until
we come in contact with the rascally pirates who infest the
coast, and lay waste your plantations. My name, my good sir,
is Captain ——, of the United States Navy; and these are
some of my men. Will you come on board, and breakfast with
us on your own snipes?'" No wonder that the major, having
been subject to the visits of these marauders, should have taken
us in the dusk, armed as we were, and withal not having precisely
the aspect of sober citizens, for persons not quite as
good as we should be. But I must now conclude, and in my
next you shall hear something of the result of my expedition
into the marshes.

After wading through mud for whole days, exposed
to scorching heat, and constantly annoyed by myriads
of insects in the course of their numerous excursions on
shore, they reached Galveston Bay on the 24th of April.
The fort of Galveston returned their salute of "26
fires," given by the big gun on the <i>Campbell</i>, and shortly
after they received a visit from the Secretary of the
Navy of the Republic of Texas, which under Sam Houston
had declared its independence but a few weeks before
their arrival, and were invited to proceed to the seat of
government, at Houston, eighty miles distant, in the
interior. They landed on the 26th of April, and after
three weeks had been spent in exploring Galveston
Island and its adjacent shores for birds and animals
of all sorts, they started for Houston on the 8th of
May. After making about twelve miles, their vessel
grounded on Red Fish Bar, and the party then took to
tender and gig, reaching their destination on the 15th;
wild turkeys, ibises, and ducks of many kinds were seen
in great numbers along their course.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Audubon has left a graphic account<a name='FA_143' id='FA_143' href='#FN_143' class='fnanchor'>[143]</a> of what he
then saw at the capital of this short-lived infant Republic,
including its picturesque President, the <i>mêlée</i> of
dejected Mexican prisoners then gathered there, and
its drunken Indians, "halooing and stumbling about in
the mud in every direction." Houston's abode was a
small log house, "consisting of two rooms, with a passage
through, after the Southern fashion."
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The moment we stepped over the threshold, on the right
hand of the passage, we found ourselves ushered into what in
other countries would be called the ante-chamber; the ground
floor, however, was muddy and filthy; a large fire was burning;
a small table, covered with paper and writing materials, was in
the centre; camp-beds, trunks, and different materials were
strewn around the room. We were at once presented to several
members of the cabinet, some of whom bore the stamp of intellectual
ability, simple though bold, in their general appearance....
</p>

<p>
The President was engaged in the opposite room on national
business, and we could not see him for some time. Meanwhile
we amused ourselves by walking to the capitol, which
was yet without a roof, and the floors, benches and tables of
both houses of Congress were as well saturated with water as
our clothes had been in the morning. Being invited by one of
the great men of the place to enter a booth to take a drink of
grog with him, we did so; but I was rather surprised that he
offered his name, instead of the cash, to the bar-keeper.
</p>

<p>
We first caught sight of President Houston as he walked
from one of the grog-shops, where he had been to prevent the
sale of ardent spirits. He was on his way to his house, and
wore a large gray coarse hat, and the bulk of his figure reminded
me of the appearance of General Hopkins of Virginia,
for like him he is upwards of six feet high, and strong in proportion.
But I observed a scowl in the expression of his eyes,
that was forbidding and disagreeable. We reached his abode
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
before him, but he soon came, and we were presented to his
excellency. He was dressed in a fancy velvet coat, and trowsers
trimmed with broad gold-lace; around his neck was tied a cravat
somewhat in the style of seventy-six. He received us kindly,
was desirous of retaining us for awhile, and offered us every
facility within his power. He at once removed us from the
anteroom to his private chamber, which by the way was not
much cleaner than the former. We were severally introduced
by him to the different members of his cabinet and staff, and
at once asked to drink grog with him, which we did, wishing
success to his new republic. Our talk was short; but the impression
which was made on my mind at the time by himself,
his officers, and his place of abode, can never be forgotten.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The party left Texas on the 18th of May, and on
the 27th reached New Orleans, which was then oppressively
hot and nearly deserted. Here Audubon's collections
and equipment were packed to be sent north;
his dog was given to his brother-in-law, William Bakewell,
and on the last day of the month the party began
to retrace their steps of the previous March. After
more hard traveling by car, coach and railroad, Charleston
was reached in eight and a half days, on June 10,
1837. Edward Harris, who ascended the Mississippi
from New Orleans for the purpose of making further
collections, later rejoined the party at Bachman's home
in Charleston. Audubon said that he lost twelve pounds
in weight during this journey, which proved exceedingly
trying, and the hardships encountered were hardly commensurate
with the returns in bird and animal lore; yet
Audubon was by no means dissatisfied at the results,
as shown by the following account which he gave Thomas
Brewer two days after his return:<a name='FA_144' id='FA_144' href='#FN_144' class='fnanchor'>[144]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The weather during the principal portion of our absence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
was unusually cold, even for the season, and this gave us, perhaps,
the very best opportunities ever afforded to any student
of nature to observe the <i>inward</i> migrations of myriads of the
birds that visit us from the south and west when the imperative
laws of nature force them from their winter retreats towards
other countries to multiply. To tell you all regarding this
would be more by a thousand times than can be given in a letter
written in haste, and I will therefore at once touch the spring
with whose sound you are most in harmony. We procured
many eggs for you—ay, a great number—and as soon as we
reach New York I will make up a large box, and take it to you
myself.... One thing that will interest you most, as it did
me, is that we found west of the Mississippi many species of
ducks breeding as contented as if in latitude 68° north. There
is, after all, nothing like seeing things or countries to enable one
to judge of their peculiarities, and I now feel satisfied that
through the want of these means many erroneous notions remain
in scientific works that can not otherwise be eradicated.
We found not one new species, but the mass of observations
that we have gathered connected with the ornithology of our
country, has, I think, never been surpassed. I feel myself now
tolerably competent to give an essay on the geographical distribution
of the feathered tribes of our dear country, and I
promise that I will do so, with naught but facts and notes made
on the very spot, and at the fitting time.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Maria Rebecca Bachman, eldest of the nine Bachman
children, was married at this time to John Woodhouse
Audubon, and the entire party started north
before the end of June. They went by steamer to Norfolk,
and thence to Washington, where Audubon presented
his letters to President Van Buren and tendered
his thanks in person to the various officers of the Government
and friends who had aided his expedition; they
passed rapidly through Baltimore and Philadelphia, to
New York, where Audubon remained a fortnight, while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
his son and daughter-in-law were enjoying a honeymoon
at Niagara Falls. All sailed from New York on the
packet <i>England</i>, and landed at Liverpool on the 2d of
August. Five days later the family was united in London.

<p>
After Audubon's return to England in the summer
of 1837, the completion of his <i>magnum opus</i> occupied
but two years. Certain now of the ultimate success
which would crown his efforts, he worked with a furious
ardor, determined not only to execute his original plans,
but to extend them, if necessary, to include every bird
which had been discovered in America, or, at least, in
the United States.
</p>

<p>
Audubon wrote Thomas Brewer in September that,
for some unexplained cause, a large part of his collections
made in Texas had probably been lost; when writing
on October 29, the box containing all the eggs collected
on the Gulf of Mexico had not come to hand.
He continued:<a name='FA_145' id='FA_145' href='#FN_145' class='fnanchor'>[145]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I authorize you to offer and to pay as much as <i>five dollars</i>
for an old <i>raven</i>, in the flesh, and perfect as far as <i>internals</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
are concerned. European writers who a few years since were
all agog to prove that our apparently analogous species were
identical with those of Europe have suddenly "faced about,"
and pronounce our birds to be quite distinct species, and of
course now say that our raven is indeed our raven! and all this
because I proved that the <i>Corvus corone</i> of Europe existed not
in America. All this induces the present <i>natural</i> student of nature
to have his eyes and all his senses fully open, and to see
into things further than we can into grindstones....
</p>

<p>
Charles Bonaparte, who has just this moment left me, has
kindly proffered me his new North American species, and I hope
to figure them all, thereby rendering my work the more complete,
if not quite perfect, as far as truly well-known species
are now thought to exist in the limits of our country, or indeed
those of North America.
</p>
</div>

<p>
When writing his young friend again, on November
18, he implored him to proceed
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
with all possible industry, in procuring the birds of my list, in
rum. I hope you will have a pair of pied ducks (<i>Fuligula
labradora</i>) for me. Send me all the drawings of eggs you can
so that they reach me here by the 1st to 10th of March next. If
the birds arrive in London by the middle of April, it will do....
I send you inclosed the copy of an advertisement of my
work, which I wish you to hand over to our most generous
friend George Parkman, Esq., M.D., and ask him to have it
inserted in one or more of the Boston newspapers as soon as
convenient.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Again, on the 22nd, he admonished his friend not to send
his "drawings of eggs by <i>letter</i>," but to forward all such
to N. Berthoud, "and ask him to send them by captains
of London packets. The postages are very heavy these
hard times, and I am not a <i>prince</i>."
</p>

<p>
Although Audubon's "Prospectus" called for only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
eighty parts of 400 plates, by 1837 the number of new
discoveries had multiplied to such an extent that he faced
the dilemma of either enlarging his work or issuing it in
an incomplete state. In the summer of that year large
numbers of his British patrons discontinued their subscriptions,
a result, no doubt, of the disastrous panic
which had driven many into bankruptcy, and still more
refused to take any plates in excess of the stipulated
number. To alleviate this anticipated difficulty, he had
already begun to admit composite plates, on which from
two to six different kinds of birds were grouped together,
much in the older style which he abhorred; but, in spite
of this concession and omission of the eggs, colored figures
of which he had hoped to give at the end, he was
obliged to add seven parts, thus swelling the total number
of large plates to 435, which represented 489 supposedly
distinct species of American birds.
</p>

<p>
When Audubon was facing such protests in England,
Dr. J. K. Townsend<a name='FA_146' id='FA_146' href='#FN_146' class='fnanchor'>[146]</a> returned to Philadelphia
with a second great collection from the Far West. How
eager he was, at this psychological moment, to gain access
to these ornithological treasures is clearly shown in
the following letter<a name='FA_147' id='FA_147' href='#FN_147' class='fnanchor'>[147]</a> to Edward Harris:

I have this moment received your dear letter of the 4. instant,
for the contents of which, I do indeed most truly thank
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
you, but the most important point contained in it, Dr. Spencer
is now at Paris quite well and happy. I have not heard of his
supposed intentions to visit Russia, at least not until you have
shown yourself in Europe for awhile. When will you come?
I have not received one single letter from Dr. Morton since my
return to England, and have been the more surprised at this,
because I look upon <i>him</i> as a worthy good man and as one
whom, since my last visit to him, I cannot but consider as my
friend.
</p>

<p>
The return of Dr. Townsend to our happy land has filled
me with joy, and trebly so when you tell me that he is as
friendly disposed to me as I ever have been towards him. I
congratulate you my dear friend, in the step which you have
so kindly taken in my favour, by first selecting all such Bird-skins
as you or Townsend have considered as new, and also in
having given freedom to Dr. Morton to pay Dr. Townsend
Fifty Dollars for the skins selected by you, under the <i>prudent</i>
considerations or restrictions talked of in your letter. May I
receive all the Bird skins very soon, for depend upon it, now
or never is for me the period to push on my publication. If
I have any regret to express it is, that Townsend or Dr. Morton
or yourself did not at once forward to me the <i>whole</i> of the Bird
skins brought latterly by Townsend, for I can assure you that
it has become a matter of the <i>greatest niceity</i> to distinguish the
slight though <i>positive</i> species lines of demarkation between our
species of Birds—and if on this reaching you, the least doubt
exists amongst yourselves respecting any one, why send it to
me at once by the very earliest conveyance. If by New York,
with letter to N. Berthoud to lose not a day, provided a packet,
either to <i>Liverpool</i> or London, is ready to sail! Had Townsend
sent me the <i>whole</i> of his disposible birds, I might now have perhaps
been able to have mad[e] him a remittance in cash, which
the single arrival of the German Naturalists, who are now in
California may hereafter put an end to. Mention this to him,
nay, shew him this letter if you please and assure him that I am
willing to exert myself in his behalf. Indeed, I wish you to
urge him in forwarding me either his own manuscripts or a copy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
of all such parts as appertain to Birds, as soon as possible,
knowing (I think) that he will not undertake to publish them
himself under his present (I am sorry to say) embarrassed
pecuniary circumstances. Tell him that I want all about the
habits of <i>any</i> Birds which he has written upon, especially,
however, those found from the beginning of his journeys until
his return, and appertaining to species belonging to our fauna
or otherwise. Their exact measurements, dates, localities,
migratories or vice versa inclinations, descriptions of nests,
eggs &amp;c. periods of breeding; in a word all that he can, or will
be pleased to send me—and you may assure Townsend, that all
he will confide to me will be published as coming from <i>him</i>, although
I may think fit to alter the phraseology in some instances.
Tell him to be extremely careful in naming his new
species, and that [if] he thinks of difficulties in this matter, to
leave it to me, as <i>here</i> I am able to see all the late published
works (and they are not a few) and work out the species with
more advantage than any one can at present in Philadelphia.
Do not take this as egotism far from it, it is in friendship and
for his sake that I venture on undertaking such an arduous
task. I am <i>exceedingly</i> [anxious] to receive a letter from him
(for Nuttall, though an excellent friend of mine and a most
worthy man, will not answer me in time on this subject) of <i>all</i>
the birds contained in the <i>plates</i> now at the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philada., <i>which he saw on the Rocky Mountains</i>,
over those mountains, <i>on the Columbia River</i> and off <i>the coast</i>
of our <i>Western boundaries</i>. This I want much, and if he would
simply dictate to you plate 1, not there, plate 2, there, plate 3
there &amp;c. &amp;c. this would amply answer my purpose, and this I
wish you not to neglect to forward me <i>as soon as possible by
duplicate</i>! Of course I cannot speak upon any one of the new
species of which you speak until I have examined them all. To
talk of new species in London is a matter not now understood
in any part of America, and sorry will you be as well as himself,
when I assure you that out of the <i>twelve</i> supposed to be,
and published by Dr. Morton, from Townsend's first cargo, not
more than six are actually undescribed, although I have taken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
upon myself the risk of publishing <i>his</i> names to the Birds on
my plate, but which of course I am obliged to correct in my
letter press. <i>The little beautiful owl</i>, I would venture to say
has been described by Vigors at least ten years ago, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Swainson never goes to bed without describing some new species,
and Charles Bonaparte, during his late visit to London, has
published as many as 20 of a night at the Museum of the Zoological
Society Insects &amp;c. &amp;c. Stir, work hard, [be] <i>prompt</i>
in every thing. My work <i>must</i> soon be finished, and unless
<i>all is received here</i> by the month of May next, why I shall have
to abandon to others what I might myself have accomplished.
God bless you, many happy years. We are all well, thank
God, just now. Remember me and us kindly to all around and
every friend and believe me ever your most truly and sincerely
attached friend,

If Townsend has brought Birds Eggs, ask him to send them

regret that you did not find me the <i>water</i> Birds of which you
speak, as I might have perchance found something new or
curious among them. The Golden Eye Duck especially, if any
be had?
</p>
</div>

<p>
In reference to the new species of birds which had
come into his hands, Audubon said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
What was I to do? Why, to publish them, to be sure; for
this I should have done, to the best of my power, even if every
subscriber in Europe had refused to take them. What! said I,
shall the last volume of the "Birds of America" be now closed,
at a time when new species are in my hands? No! And in
spite of threats from this quarter and that, that such and such
persons would discontinue their subscriptions (which indeed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
they have done), and refuse to take the few numbers that would
have rendered their copies complete, my wish to do all that was
in my power has been accomplished.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Doubtless we should hesitate to blame many of Audubon's
subscribers for wishing to be relieved from an
obligation which for a period of ten years had cost them
from $50 to $100 per annum, not to speak of any who
had met financial disaster in the panic of that day, but
at this juncture he really had no choice. When his
eightieth Number, originally intended to be the last, appeared
in 1837, many important kinds of birds, including
ducks, swan, tern, and the Flamingo, as well as
grouse, warblers and woodpeckers, were still calling loud
for recognition. So generous of space had he been in the
earlier phase of his undertaking that twenty species were
each shown on two distinct plates, while in the end the
need of compression compelled him to introduce thirty-five
composite plates.
</p>

<p>
Subscribers to <i>The Birds of America</i> at the beginning
had been permitted to take a part or the whole, and
many incomplete sets were circulated, upwards of 120,
as Audubon declared in 1839, having then discontinued
their subscriptions. Towards the end of his undertaking,
owing to the great expense and uncertainty involved,
he was disinclined to supply any but regular
subscribers, as shown by the following letter written
from London, May 25, 1838, to William A. Colman
of New York:<a name='FA_148' id='FA_148' href='#FN_148' class='fnanchor'>[148]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... We find that six of the plates you want are not only
largest figs, but some of them extremely full and difficult to
colour, and he [Mr. Havell] says that our Printers and our
Colourers would not undertake to go throu them without charging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
a most extravagant price. I have no extra plates whatever
on hand, and in consequence of this must be obliged to decline
furnishing you with them.
</p>

<p>
If at the conclusion of my publication I find any of the
plates you want they will be sent to you forthwith, but I wish
you not to calculate upon this until you hear again from me,
or from my sons on this subject.
</p>

<p>
My work will [be] entirely finished by the end of next
month, when our engraving and Printing establishment will be
broken up, and few will indeed there be copies to be had by any
one, who has not subscribed to the "Birds of America."
</p>

<p>
Should you see any of my American subscribers who have
not as yet seen any portion of the work, please to assure them
that as soon as the fourth volume is quite finished, and <i>bound</i>
according to their desires, their copies will be forwarded at
once to their respective homes, or to whomsoever they have
directed me to send their copies.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On May 26 Audubon wrote Thomas M. Brewer that
"Edward Harris, one of the best men of this world,"
had reached his house "yesterday at noon, after a pleasant
passage of fourteen days and a few hours." "My
illustrations," he said, "will be finished on the 20th of
next month, and the fourth volume of text shortly afterward";
at the end he added: "When I return to our
beloved land, I intend to spend a full season about the
lakes in Northern Vermont, for, from what I hear, much
knowledge is to be acquired there and thereabouts."
After returning to New York in September of the
following year, he again alluded to the ramble he would
like to take "along the borders of the famous lakes
of New Hampshire and Vermont," but was unable to
bring it to pass at that time.

<p class="post">
<span class="smcap">My dear Mr Swainson</span>,
</p>

<p>
The severe indisposition of my good wife which has continued
almost unabated now since I had the pleasure of seeing
you, is my excuse for not having ere this answered your two
notes, especially the last of the 8th instant.—
</p>

<p>
Your box &amp; contents came perfectly safe to hand, and I
think will soon again be in your possession in like good order.
I certainly should like to see the Buteo [?] vulgaris to compare
it with mine (that at the mouth of the Columbia) and the one
described by Nuttall before the return from America of D. [Dr.
John] Richardson &amp; of which it seems you were not aware.—I
am glad nevertheless that if differing from the European
bird of that name the Transatlantic bird will be honoured by
your own name.
</p>

<p>
Charles Bonaparte is at Paris &amp; is to remain there. I am
well informed for about a fortnight.—He left London in great
haste and I assure you has left no parcels or letters for you
or anybody else either with us or with Havell.—I am sorry
that he should have disapointed you &amp; your dear Children
but——.
</p>

<p>
I cannot say just now whether I have a specimen of Muscicapa
Trailli "the Prince" having two of my giving, if however,
I have another I will send it to you with great good will &amp;
pleasure—As regards your queries respecting several species
of quiscalus or Crow black birds You are correct for I have
myself discovered two in America one in the Floridas the other
in the Arkansaw River, both of which will be given in my work.—That
more exist I have no doubt especially further South and
West.
</p>

<p>
You have described a swan in the Fauna Boriali Americana
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
under the name of the Cygnus Bewicki, but as your measurements
there and then given are very far from those of the swan
now known under the name of Old Bewick I should feel obliged
to you to let me know whether the specimen you described from
was the identical bird procured by Captain Lyons, and of which
that gentleman described the nest? And again I should like
you to tell me whether you have seen the Clangula vulgaris
of Linn. that in the months of April &amp; May?
</p>

<p>
Many thanks for all your kind wishes &amp; may you and yours
enjoy the like return of many many new &amp; happy years.—Call
upon us when you come to Town and believe me my dear Mr
Swainson ever sincerily

Audubon's day of greatest triumph came on June
20, 1838, when he had the supreme satisfaction of seeing
the last plate of his "Book of Nature," <i>The Birds of
America</i>, completed. Having been begun virtually in
the autumn of 1826, it was in press nearly twelve years.
The sumptuous character of this work, its commanding
beauty, as well as its surprising accuracy, considering all
the obstacles of time and circumstance, mark it, when
combined with its letterpress, as one of the most remarkable
and interesting undertakings in the history of literature
and science in the nineteenth century. Unique
as it was in every detail of its workmanship, it will
remain for centuries a shining example of the triumph
of human endeavor and of the spirit and will of man.
This is true in spite of any errors it may disclose, and
even if it be conceded that bare bones and plain photographs
are more valuable for elucidating the technicalities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
of science than the most artistic productions of the
pen, pencil or brush.
</p>

<p>
Audubon's labors in England, however, did not end
with the completion of his plates, for two volumes of
his "Biographies" still remained to be published. He was
in London during the early summer of 1838, when he
recorded a visit from John Bachman, who had come to
Europe for the recuperation of his health. He was then
obliged to hasten to Edinburgh, where he was soon
joined by both Bachman and Victor Audubon and
later by other members of his family. For the convenience
of work he took rooms near the museums, on
the south side of the city, not far from Lauriston Place
and within easy reach of "The Meadows," a well known
recreation ground.

his arrival at the Scottish capital, and addressed "No. 4
Wimpole Street, London," abounds in interesting personal
details, but the student of birds would find more
significant its clear statement of his relations with MacGillivray;
it shows us the anatomist at work, and Audubon
as his student and "secretary." "Under his kind
tuition," he said, when writing at a little later time, "I
think I have learned something of anatomy, which may
enable me, at some future period, to produce observations
that may prove interesting...."

<p>
Your joint letter of the 27th Wednesday, did not reach
me until yesterday afternoon, probably because the steamer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
which brought it did not leave London on that evening on a/c
of the coronation etc., Here the festivals were poor beyond
description, and although scarcely anything was to be seen, the
whole population was on foot the entire day, and nearly the
whole night, gazing at each other like lost sheep.—No illuminations
except at two shops, Mr. Henderson's and another close
by him.—The fireworks at the castle consisted merely of about
one hundred rockets, not a gun was fired from the batteries.
MacGillivray &amp; I went to see the fireworks at 10 p.m., and soon
returned disgusted.—His museum (College of Surgeons) and
the Edinburgh Museum were thrown open <i>gratis</i>, and were
thronged to excess Upwards of 20000 in the first, and about
25000 in the other; all was however quite orderly. The day
was showery; cloudy and dismal at times, but the evening was
clear and fine.—Mr. Hill's father died on the morning of the
27th and I have not seen Alexander H., since. Many thanks
to Maria for her bunch of letters, and the few lines of her own
to me, I hope that everything will go on well with you all.
</p>

<p>
We begin printing <i>tomorrow 2d of July, 1838!!</i> remember
that Mesdames et Messieurs! and I intend to proceed with all
possible despatch and care. <i>All</i> the birds in rum will be inspected
as far as internal or digestive organs, trachea &amp;c are
concerned, and as I am constantly present in the dissecting
room, I think I shall know something about the matter anon.—I
am almost in hopes to see Victor tomorrow night but cannot
be sure. There are somewhere at home the nests of the birds
found on the Columbia by Nuttall and Townsend, I believe that
of Bewick's Wren is among them; send them <i>all</i>, very carefully
packed. I want the journal of my first trip to the Floridas,
which was cut out of my large leather journal, previous to
going to Labrador, also a letter on the habits of the Yellow-bellied
Cuckoo, by a gentleman at Charleston. If it cannot be
found perhaps Maria will recollect his name, being a friend of
John Bachman, if so send me that, <i>in full</i> if possible. It is the
gentleman in whose garden I procured the small and large
cuckoos in the same nest.—
</p>

<p>
I have written fortyfour articles for my appendix and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
will continue whenever I am not otherwise engaged, so as to
save time at last.—I am sorry for the death of poor Wickliffe
but glad that his brother was with him at New York previously,
and that we, at least, have done all that we could for him.
MacGillivray is quite well, and works very hard, poor fellow—I
am glad of John's repainting the head by VanDyke, two copies
of such heads are valuable to him, besides his improving by
so working—When Victor has left for this place, John must
pay much attention to the colourers and call also at the bookbinder.
Havell ought to exert himself in having some 4th vols;
delivered as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
My last letter which was written last Sunday, was put too
late in the office, which closed on that day at two o'clock, and
did not therefore leave this till four o'clock on Monday afternoon;
this one will have a better chance, for I will take it myself
to the general office. I have seen no one hardly since my last,
I am indeed as busily engaged as ever, and rarely go to bed
before eleven—being with Mr. MacGillivray until generally
past ten, describing etc., I rise at four or earlier, he at ten;
but I go to bed at eleven, he at two. I discovered that he was
adverse to the examination of the intestinal canals etc., because
many of my birds which are common to both countries will be
published before his 2d vol., can now possibly be; but as soon
as I told him that I had already said in my introduction, that
the anatomical structure was declared to be <i>his</i>, he was much
pleased and began on the instant.
</p>

<p>
Today is very dismal, and it will rain probably until night;
I wish we had here some of the warm weather of which dearest
Mamma speaks. I have had but one walk to Arthur's Seat, but
now and then I stroll to the meadows which are close to me, and
now look well.—From the window of my sitting room I overlook
the garden of Mr. Frazer our printer, and now and then speak
to him there, I have not yet however visited him.—I will recollect
the Queen's farthing when next I see Professor Wilson, but
doubt much if he will recollect the least idea of it. Has Charley
written or said anything to Victor about the review of the
work; remember me to Healey.—

Audubon's fourth volume, the printing of which
was announced in this letter, was published in November,
and at the conclusion of the introduction he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I believe the time to be fast approaching when much of the
results obtained from the inspection of the exterior alone will
be laid aside; when museums filled with the stuffed skins will
be considered insufficient to afford a knowledge of birds; and
when the student will go forth not only to observe the habits
and haunts of animals, but to procure specimens of them to be
carefully dissected.
</p>
</div>

<p>
These prophetic remarks, which were no doubt inspired
by the studies of MacGillivray, have found ample justification
in the later history of ornithology; to give a
single illustration, it was through the aid of anatomy
only, in this instance, of the vocal organs, that modern
students have been able to define the true Passerine or
Oscine birds, as distinguished from all others, and as
the highest representatives of the avian class.

In the autumn of 1838, when Mrs. Audubon was still
suffering from impaired health, the naturalist paused
in his work to indulge in a short vacation, the first in
many years. On September 14, he wrote to Edward
Harris, who was then in Scotland:<a name='FA_151' id='FA_151' href='#FN_151' class='fnanchor'>[151]</a>

With MacGillivray as guide, Audubon and his family
visited Stirling, Doun and Callander, where they
"marched in a body to the Falls of Bracklin, guided by
a rosy-cheeked Highland lassie, stopping now and then
by the way to pick up a wild flower,—a blue-bell, a
'gowan,' or a dog-rose, or to listen to the magpies and
titmice." From Callander they ascended to Loch Katrine,
and explored the Trossachs, "admired by many,
chiefly or entirely on account of Scott's description of
them"; at the tavern there, said Audubon, "with that
most curious innate desire which there is in us of becoming
older, for the purpose of enjoying the morrow, I
went to rest, anxious to see the morn, and discover what
existed beyond the crags that had bounded my view."
</p>

<p>
From the wild and beautiful scenes about Loch
Katrine, which stirred the naturalist's emotions and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
evoked the desire to remain until the curtain of night
had gradually and peacefully closed the landscape from
their view, they proceeded to the rocky shores of Loch
Lomond, where they found "a few small stone cabins,
some fat bairns, abundance of ale, and a sufficiency of
capital whisky." After crossing to Tarbet and examining
both the head and the foot of the lake, they went
on from Balloch to Dumbarton by stage, and thence by
steamer to Glasgow; there they spent a few days, and
returned to Edinburgh by way of Dumbarton and Lanark.
Steamers and coaches, slow as they then were,
were all too fast for Audubon on this journey, and he
declared that if ever again he visited the Highlands,
it should be on foot, "for no man, with nerve and will,
and an admirer of the beauties of nature, can ever truly
enjoy the pleasures of travelling, unless he proceed in
this manner."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Audubon's health had not improved by the
journey, for shortly after their return she was again
taken ill; she was placed in the care of Dr. John Argyle
Robertson, for whose efficient aid and "kind and gentle
treatment," said Audubon, "we can never cease to cherish
the most lively feelings of affection." "It is a curious
part of my history," he continues, "that during the
whole of my sojourn in Britain, none of the principal
medical advisers whom we had occasion to employ would
receive any recompense from us."
</p>

<p>
By the 5th of November, 1838, but a few days after
the issue of the fourth volume of his "Biographies," the
printing of the fifth and last had already begun. The
following letter<a name='FA_152' id='FA_152' href='#FN_152' class='fnanchor'>[152]</a> is interesting for its personal details,

<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>:
</p>

<p>
Your letter of the 13th. instant to Victor reached us this
morning, and glad were we all to hear from you.
</p>

<p>
My object in writing to you is, for the purpose of assuring
you that I feel great [pleasure] in preparing a box of bird
skins for you according to your desire. It is true, however,
that I am now on the eve of commencing my synoptical arrangement
of our birds, I shall not be able to show you as many of
my specimens [as] I could otherwise have done, but you must
take the will for the deed. The Box will be taken as far as
London by Victor, who will leave us on the first of January.
You will find in it a list of the contents, and I trust such bird
skins as may answer your purpose well. Besides these Victor
will also attend to your request as soon as in New York and
will ship to you by way of Havre as you direct.
</p>

<p>
I am glad that you should have seen what you conceive to
be the great rara avis F. Washingtonii. I am sorry you could
not have pocketed it, but who knows if it is not left yet in store
for you—and I to shoot a pair of these noble birds at The
West, and that, after having satisfactorily examined its habits,
its eggs, or its young! <i>Bonaparte</i>, between you and I, is exceedingly
ignorant as regards our birds, as I found to my cost
when he was in London, and where he pumped me sadly too
much, but it is now over and I forgive him as I do all others who
have or who <i>may</i> try to injure me.
</p>

<p>
John Bachman wrote to me that he had left in commission
to Trudeau, the purchase for me of a copy of Vieillot's Oiseaux
de l'Amérique Septentrionale, and also a copy of Boié or Bojé
work<a name='FA_154' id='FA_154' href='#FN_154' class='fnanchor'>[154]</a> on birds generally, but I have received neither books or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
promises of them from Trudeau as yet, perhaps you would
undertake the task yourself, and show to Havell as soon as
possible, for I shall be sadly in want of them in a few weeks
more. I should also like you to try to find Mr. Augustus
Thorndike of Boston, to whom Victor wrote a few days ago,
with the view to inquire from that Gentleman when he wished
<i>his</i> copy of the Birds of America to be delivered. Victor addressed
his letter to "his Hotel" or to the care of the "American
Embassy." We are not sure, however, whether he is in Paris
at present, and let me know what discoveries you have made
as regards this.—Victor will remain ten days in London and
wishes you, should you write to him there, to put your letter
<i>under cover</i> to <i>Havell</i> and request him to <i>keep</i> it. Victor will
write you from thence.
</p>

<p>
I cannot account why Trudeau has not written to me in
answer to my last, now full two months old? Should you <i>perchance</i>
discover a specimen of the Bird of Washington in Paris
and purchase the same, I should like you to send it to me <i>on
loan</i> to enable me to compare it with mine, and the Immature
of the <i>F. Albicilla of Europe</i>!
</p>

<p>
I have got twelve sheets of the 5th. Vol. of Biographies
already printed, and I expect to have quite finished by the 1st.
of April next. I have decided on the <i>Trichas</i> resembling <i>Sylvia
Philadelphia</i> of Wilson. It is a distinct species, but what will
probably surprise you more, the <i>S. Agilis</i> of the same author is
also perfectly distinct from either. All this you will plainly see
when you read their separate descriptions and compare the
three species.
</p>

<p>
I wish you would ask Trudeau whether <i>he</i> recollects the
specimen of an Eagle send by Townsend in his first collection,
numbering 54 and which the latter has lost, though he considered
it as a new species. It was procured in California.
Townsend speaks sorrowfully of the loss of this specimen. It
never came under my eye, did it come under yours? Ask Trudeau
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
whether he ever saw my Hirundo Serripennis in America.
Bachman wrote to me that Trudeau thought he had in the skins
of Frederick Ward. I think Trudeau will be pleased with the
anatomy of our birds, as it opens misteries hitherto unknown
in connection with the relative affinities of some species toward
others and assists in the formation of groups &amp;c., in what some
day or other, will be called a <i>Natural arrangement</i>!
</p>

<p>
I wish I could have spent a few weeks in Paris with you
and Trudeau, as I readily imagine that some new species of
North American birds, may yet be found there unknown to the
World of Science. I have written to Mr. Chevalier and to
Townsend, but will not, I dare say, hear anything more of the
former until through Victor, who intends to see him very shortly
after his arrival in America.
</p>

<p>
My Dear Wife is much better than when you saw her, and
I hope that when once again she has been safely landed on our
shores and enjoyed the warmth of our own Summers, her health
will be quite restored.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Little</i> Lucy has grown as fat as butter, and the rest of
us are well.
</p>

<p>
We all unite in kindest best wishes to you and to Trudeau,
and I remain as ever, my Dear Friend,

<p>
In May, 1839, Audubon's fifth and last volume of
the <i>Ornithological Biography</i>, consisting of 704 pages,
was issued. It was followed almost immediately by <i>A
Synopsis of the Birds of North America</i>, in which the
efficient aid of MacGillivray was again enlisted. On
May 4 Audubon wrote to Havell that this work was
in press and would be ready in about a month's time;
again, on the 30th of June he announced that it was
finished and in the hands of the binder. With this
methodical catalogue of the birds of North America
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
then known and described, to the number of 491, fifty-two
of which were new, Audubon's life and labors in
England were brought to a close.
</p>

<p>
The introduction to the last volume of his "Biographies"
begins as follows:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
How often, Good Reader, I have longed to see the day on
which my labours should be brought to an end! Many times,
when I had laid myself down in the deepest recesses of the
western forests, have I been suddenly awakened by the apparition
of dismal prospects that have presented themselves to my
mind. Now, sickness, methought, had seized me with burning
hand, and hurried me away, in spite of all my fond wishes, from
those wild woods in which I had so long lingered, to increase
my knowledge of the objects which they offered to my view.
Poverty, too, at times walked hand in hand with me, and on
more than one occasion urged me to cast away my pencils,
destroy my drawings, abandon my journals, change my ideas,
and return to the world.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Later on he says: "You may well imagine how happy
I am at this moment, when ... I find my journeys all
finished, my anxieties vanished, my mission accomplished;"
and he concludes: "I have pleasure in saying
that my enemies have been few, and my friends numerous.
May the God who granted me life, industry, and
perseverance to accomplish my task, forgive the former,
and forever bless the latter!"
</p>

<p>
Audubon's introductions to the five volumes of his
"Biographies," from which we have frequently quoted,
are characteristic; in them he cheers his subscribers, calls
all his helpers and correspondents by name, and takes
the public into his confidence by recording the acts which
marked the steady progress of his work. Frequent appeals
to the "good" and "gentle reader" have gone out
of fashion, but in this instance they seem in keeping with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
the style and character of the man, and they were not
made in vain. Audubon's belief in his mission was so
plainly sincere, his power so manifest and his enthusiasm
so ardent, that there were few who did not gladly acclaim
the extraordinary success of the man who twelve
years before had landed in Liverpool poor and unknown.
</p>

<p>
In the winter and spring of 1839, while Audubon
was engaged in Edinburgh and Victor was in America,
the settlement of his business affairs in London was
entrusted mainly to Robert Havell, his engraver. At
that time Havell was also pulling up roots, for he had
caught the spirit of his patron and had decided to emigrate
with his family to the United States; this involved
disposing of his stock and breaking up his engraving
and printing establishment at 77 Oxford Street. Havell
had acquired distinction as well as a competence through
his long engagement with Audubon, and being then in
his forty-sixth year, he doubtless looked to America
as a field for the fuller expression of his artistic aspirations
and talents. How anxious Audubon was at this
juncture regarding the disposition of the residual stock
of his plates, his drawings, and his books, then in Havell's
hands, is seen by the following letter,<a name='FA_155' id='FA_155' href='#FN_155' class='fnanchor'>[155]</a> written at
Edinburgh, in the winter of this year.

<p>
I perceive by the date of your letter of the 16th instant
that you must have been some days beyond my expectations,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
in the receiving of my parcel to you, and that on that account
my letter of Saturday last crossed yours of the same date. I
thank you for what you say as regards the balance in my favor
at Wright and Co.
</p>

<p>
Does Henry sail from <i>London Docks</i> or from <i>Portsmouth</i>?
and pray what is the name of the Captain of the "Wellington"?
I do not precisely understand what you mean by the <i>loose sets</i>
which you desire to know how they should be packed? let me
hear what they are and how many of them by return of mail.
The <i>five</i> perfect sets I think might all go into one case, tinned
as usual and insured of course to the full amount of their value,
as well as all others and to which I pray you to attend as if
for your own self. It is impossible for me to go to London at
present and indeed I cannot exactly tell when I will, and I trust
to you entirely for the seeing that all the volumes are fair and
good and passed through <i>your own</i> inspection of them before
they are packed. No volumes of Biographies must be put in
the same boxes.
</p>

<p>
When you have disposed of your business, what will you do
with what you have on hand belonging to us? This requires
an answer from you at once. You have a great number of
volumes of Biographies, Pictures, &amp;c. &amp;c., a regular list of
which you ought to send me. I cannot yet say when the 5th
vol. of Biographies will be finished, but will let you know as
soon as I can. I received yesterday morning a letter from a
gentleman who has procured a copy of the work through Mr.
Eame the bookseller, he says that he has called upon you to say
that he is missing <i>one plate</i> and begs to have a copy of the
plate struck and remitted to Mr. Eame who will pay you whatever
price the extra trouble on this account may amount to, but
he does not say what plate it is, and I therefor suppose that
you do? If so as he is the brother-in-law of Mr. Walker of
Ravensfield Park, one of our <i>good</i> subscribers I would say do
it for him! My wife begs of you to save all the loose prints
which were returned to you by our son Victor, as well as any
others whatever, perhaps among them you might find one to
send Mr. Eame's subscriber?

On the 4th of this month the 'Great Western' was nearly
half way across the Atlantic!! Sir William Jardine has published
a capital review of the work! What a strange world we

at Henry's, if he has finished them, where they are &amp;c. &amp;c.

How fully Audubon's injunctions in regard to his
residual stock, and particularly to scattered plates of
the <i>Birds</i>, were followed, is not known, but it is certain
that a part of this residuum remained in England, where
it is occasionally turned up even at the present day. In
a considerable number of the original plates which were
found in a bookshop in New Oxford Street in August,
1912, twelve were in the uncolored state, and several
had the appearance of rejects; moreover, in a collection
of these plates received from England in 1910, there
were nine copies of the same subject, the Painted Bunting
(No. 11, Plate 53). Though a complete set of the
plain plates is known,<a name='FA_156' id='FA_156' href='#FN_156' class='fnanchor'>[156]</a> and a considerable number were
probably dispersed in America, they are very rare.
</p>

<p>
Audubon wrote to Havell again on the 13th of
March, when he complained of the gross mistakes made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
by the "idle rascals" who were employed in filling orders
in his shop, and who had so sadly mixed matters that
no less than twelve numbers of his <i>Birds</i> had come back
to him, some of them containing one, three, and five
copies of the same plate, instead of a "Number," and
mixtures of the most incongruous sort; he thought that
"a clever young man as a clerk was worth a hundred
thick heads," and begged Havell again to send him "a
correct list of what he shipped to America on his account,
and that list not made by any other person than
either himself or Mrs. Havell." His next injunction,
on May 4, was to insure his copper-plates of <i>The Birds
of America</i> for £5,000, and to send them to either Victor
Audubon or Mr. N. Berthoud, Number 2 Hanover
Street, New York. At that moment Audubon was
planning to return to America with his family by the
<i>Great Western</i> on July 6. In writing again on June
30, he remarked that he was not at all certain that Havell,
who was then visiting at his native Reading, in
Berkshire, would really sail on the 25th of July, since
he had already postponed the journey so many times;
he added that it would not even surprise him if his work
on the <i>Quadrupeds</i> of America might not be out before
they could fish and shoot together in his "native land."
</p>

<p>
Havell eventually came to America with his wife
and daughter on the ship <i>Wellington</i>, in September,
1839; they landed at New York after the 15th of that
month, and for a time were the guests of the Audubons
at Number 86 White Street. His brother, Henry,<a name='FA_157' id='FA_157' href='#FN_157' class='fnanchor'>[157]</a>
who visited the United States in 1829, returned at
about this time and established a print shop in Broadway,
New York, but according to Robert's biographer,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
his enterprise was ruined by a fire, when he went back
to England and he died there about 1840. After a brief
residence in Brooklyn, Robert Havell settled at Sing
Sing, now Ossining, at a beautiful spot on the Hudson,
overlooking the Palisades, which he named "Rocky
Mount." There he devoted himself with characteristic
energy to painting and sketching, but he also engraved
and published a number of excellent views of his favorite
river, the Hudson, as well as of New York and other
American cities. In 1857 he established himself at
Tarrytown, where he built a house and studio, and where
in his later years he produced many meritorious works
in oils. "He never tired," says his biographer, "of the
great, broad, sweeping Hudson, and propped up in bed,
that he might gaze at will on this mighty river," he died
at the age of eighty-five, November 11, 1878.<a name='FA_158' id='FA_158' href='#FN_158' class='fnanchor'>[158]</a>
</p>

<p>
Havell has been described as quite the opposite of
Audubon in many of his characteristics, calm, deliberate,
not easily discouraged, and fully his equal in industry,
perseverance and determination. Audubon sometimes
complained of his friend's lax business habits, but their
long sustained and cordial relations were never broken
during life, and their mutual debt was great. The engraver's
first son, who lived but a year, was named
Robert Audubon, and the naturalist, who was his godfather,
held the child at its baptism at old St. James
Church, Oxford Street, in 1827. A descendant of Luke
Havell, who was a drawing master at Reading, uncle of
Robert the second, possesses a silver loving-cup which
Audubon presented to his engraver upon the completion
of the second volume of his illustrations; it is inscribed
"To Robert Havell, from his friend J. J. A. 1834."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When we consider the size of Audubon's plates,
which required for the portrayal of his largest subjects,
such as the Whooping Crane or Wild Turkey, an area
of no less than five square feet, it will be seen that his
engraver was compelled to adopt the most expeditious
methods. This and kindred difficulties were overcome
by Havell's skillful union of aquatint with etching and
line engraving, but some of his smaller figures, as the
Snow Birds (Plate 13), appear to have been etched
in the usual way, with but slight use of either aquatint,
dry-point or burin. In aquatinting the plate was usually
bitten to the desired depth for the softer shading of
feathers or foliage, or for the entire expression of sky,
water or landscape. Says George Alfred Williams:<a name='FA_159' id='FA_159' href='#FN_159' class='fnanchor'>[159]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Aquatint proper consists entirely of gradations of tone
produced by biting with aquafortis into the copper through a
resinous ground broken into a multitude of fine granules, that
render the personal touch practically negligible, and in consideration
of this we can appreciate the exceptionally skillful
use Havell, Junior, made of the difficult process. The graining
of the aquatint grounds is produced by allowing fine dust particles
to settle upon the freshly prepared plate. It is to these
grainings of different degrees of fineness that the engraver must
look for the subtlety of the tonal surfaces, but strength is
obtained usually through the use of the etched line. The chief
limitation of the aquatint process lies in the great difficulty of
getting more than a few differences of shade, as the ground
goes to pieces rather rapidly under successive bitings, and the
transitions from one tone to another are very few, so that half
tones are not readily obtainable. It is in the economical use
of these half tones that Havell, Junior, achieved so much and
thereby produced a chiaroscuro seldom, if ever, equaled in
aquatint.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Artists have sometimes frowned upon this combination
of aquatint with other forms of engraving, especially
when executed with the burin, for "like the permanent
misery of a quarrelling married couple, they may
ruin everything with discord"; but any such lack of harmony,
when not overcome by Havell's skill, was usually
completely subdued by the color which was subsequently
applied to the printed sheet. This is seen by
a comparison of the plain proof of such an elaborate
plate as that of the rattlesnake attacking the mocking
birds (Plate xxi) with the result attained in the finished
impression. In replying to a criticism of Havell's work
in 1830, Audubon expressed his conviction that "no birds
were ever so beautifully and softly represented on copper,"
and any hardness, which his plates rarely showed,
was not due to aquatinting, the inherent quality of which
is softness. To quote our authority again:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
In Havell's hands aquatint gave the essential structure of
forms by a judicious use of the process called "feathering."
This he often did upon the bare copper plate without a ground,
allowing the acid to bite its own granular surface. In this
way he produced the soft gradations and telling accents so
necessary to the portrayal of birds, but by a further judicious
use of line the accurate forms of both bird and plant life were
given with great force and delicacy.
</p>
</div>

<p>
When Audubon first proposed to present the Congressional
Library at Washington with a copy of his <i>Birds</i>,
he asked Havell to do all the coloring himself; Havell
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
colored his prints in the usual manner by flowing washes of
pure water-color tints over the monochrome proof which was
printed from the copper plate. In this phase of the process
the great charm of his genuine talent for water-color painting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
asserted itself. Aside from the first crude washes, put on by
artists or colorists employed for the purpose, he himself applied
the salient tones and all the more delicate tints.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Much misunderstanding has arisen in regard to the
engraving and publication of Audubon's earlier plates
owing to the complex relations which existed between
Lizars, the two Havells of the same name, and the naturalist
himself; this involved the reissue of the first two
numbers of the work, and a confusing series of legends
upon the plates themselves, occasioned partly by a division
of labor between father and son, and by the death
of Robert Havell, Senior, in 1832. The errors into
which some commentators have fallen, however, are due
to their examination of but one set of plates. The
account which follows is based upon a collation of complete
copies at the British Museum, the Radcliffe Library,
Oxford, the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, and the
Boston Society of Natural History, and of numerous
scattered plates. Lizars engraved the first ten plates
only of the large folio, but before the summer of 1827
a considerable number of these early impressions had
been distributed. The Havells, as we have seen, started
the work anew, and Robert, the younger, retouched the
greater part of Lizars' plates, so that their reissue in
London constitutes for the bibliophile a second, and in
some cases a third, edition. Moreover, the plates which
were eventually executed by the younger Havell, to the
number of 425, were repeatedly printed from to meet
the requirements of new subscribers; on such occasions
errors were corrected, minor changes in the artist's or
engraver's name introduced, and the nomenclature of
the birds and plants more or less completely revised.
Frequently the Whatman water-marks, or, indirectly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
Audubon's titles, postdate the year of publication as
printed on the plate itself. Conflicting legends, particularly
on the earlier plates, which have often puzzled
collectors, are mainly due to one or another of the conditions
named. Nearly every plate underwent alterations
of some sort, but the various legends show conclusively
whether the print belongs to a first or a subsequent
impression. In the British Museum copy, the
younger Havell's first independent legend appears on
Plate lxxvi (Virginia Partridge), as "Engraved,
Printed, &amp; Coloured by R. Havell Jun<span class="sup">r</span>. 1830." The
word "London" was later added, but was eventually discarded.
After the senior Havell's death in 1832, the son
naturally dropped the suffix from his own name; thereafter
his brief designation of name and date became
gradually stereotyped. It should be noticed, however,
that when Robert Havell needed to reprint from plates
which were executed before his father's death, he would
frequently remove only the "Junior," and let the original
date stand, so that legends like the following are
not uncommon: "Engraved, Printed, &amp; Coloured by
R. Havell, —— London—1831"; to avoid the lacuna,
designation of place and date were, at times, erased also.
The naturalist's name underwent a different evolution
on the plates, but after 1830, the date of his election to
membership in the Royal Society, his designation gradually
settled into the phrase: "Drawn from nature by J.J.
Audubon, F.L.S. F.R.S." (as in Plate lxxxi, 1830);
accordingly, all plates which bear these titles, but an
earlier date, are second or later editions. The previous
hints, with examples to be given presently, will enable
collectors to determine whether a given plate is a first
or subsequent impression.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
no dates, and, so far as known, the first date of the
entire series was "1828," which was added to Plate 31
(the White-headed Eagle), but was erased from later
issues. When Robert Havell, Junior, retouched Lizar's
engraving of the Turkey Hen (No. II, Plate vi), he
added the date "1829," but in a third or later edition the
name was changed and the date removed. This same
date appears also on the retouched Plate ii, of the Yellow-billed
Cuckoo, and on that of the Purple Grackle
or Crow Blackbird (Plate vii). A curious error crept
into the first impressions of the former plate, which
was mislabeled "Black-billed Cuckoo," a bird then recognized
as quite distinct.<a name='FA_160' id='FA_160' href='#FN_160' class='fnanchor'>[160]</a> Plates xxxi to lxxv (1828-29)
were all dated in the first issue, and bore the names
of both Havells; the legends are: "Engraved, Printed &amp;
Coloured by R. Havell &amp; Son, London, 1828," and "Engraved
by Rob<span class="sup">t</span>. Havell, Jun<span class="sup">r</span>. Printed &amp; Coloured by
R. Havell Sen<span class="sup">r</span>. London, 1828," or "1829" (British
Museum copy), but when later printed by Robert, the
younger, the dates were erased. All subsequent dating
of the plates was somewhat irregular until 1834 (Plate
ccii), but from that point to the end of the series, the
year of issue was consistently added to each plate. Ornithologists
are specially interested in the time of publication,
since forty-seven new specific names occur on
Audubon's large plates, and should date from them
and not from the letterpress which followed.

Plates which were wholly the work of Lizars have
naturally become extremely rare; they were evidently
disregarded by Audubon when he recorded on July 2,
1827, that he had given Mr. Children a proof of his
first number, which he called "the first in existence,"
and declared that the two guineas then received was the
first money that had been returned to his hands. Lizars'
initial number had actually been finished in the previous
winter, and a copy of this is recorded as having been
given to the daughter of Sir Walter Scott on the 9th
of March, 1827.
</p>

<p>
When Audubon had finally closed all his business
affairs in Edinburgh and London, late in the summer
of 1839, he returned to America, with the remaining
members of his family, and settled in New York, where
he purchased a house at Number 84 White Street, then
in the uptown district.
</p>

<p>
An anonymous writer in the London <i>Athenæum</i><a name='FA_161' id='FA_161' href='#FN_161' class='fnanchor'>[161]</a>
in giving a final review of Audubon's labors in 1839,
paid this interesting tribute:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It seems but as yesterday that we were walking about with
a transatlantic stranger, picturesque enough in his appearance
and garb, to arrest the eye of every passing gazer; a tall
stalwart man, with hair sufficiently long to qualify him to serve
as a model to Gray's "Bard," and trousers ample almost as
petticoats of "good Harmony cloth," so absorbed in the enthusiastic
prosecution of his gigantic plan—a life's labour—as
to be heedless of the singularity of those meteoric locks, and
those liberal nether garments. Some dozen of years, however,
have elapsed since that day; the American Woodsman's hair—long
since cut short—has grown white; his magnificent undertaking
is completed, and he is now on the point of quitting
England, to settle himself for the remainder of his days whether
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
by the side of a bayou, in some forest clearing, or as an inhabitant
of one of the American cities which have learned to
know his value, report saith not.
</p>

<p>
We shake hands with the author, tendering him our hearty
congratulations on the completion of a task almost as arduous
as has ever been proposed to a literary man....
</p>

<p>
The confidential simplicity of Mr. Audubon's own prefaces
would make yet more personal leave-takings and farewells, on
the critic's part, natural and graceful,—but it must suffice to
say, that few have quitted England, carrying with them a larger
portion of honest regard and sincere good wishes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Possibly it was the same writer who gave this striking
picture of Audubon in the pages of the same journal,
thirty years later:<a name='FA_162' id='FA_162' href='#FN_162' class='fnanchor'>[162]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We can remember when his portfolio excited delight in
Edinburgh, London, and Paris, rivalling in smaller circles a
new Waverley novel. The man also was not a man to be seen
and forgotten, or passed on the pavement without glances of
surprise and scrutiny. The tall and somewhat stooping form,
the clothes not made by a West-end but by a Far West tailor,
the steady, rapid, springing step, the long hair, the aquiline
features, and the glowing angry eyes,—the expression of a
handsome man conscious of ceasing to be young, and an air and
manner which told you that whoever you might be he was John
Audubon, will never be forgotten by anyone who knew or saw
him.
</p>
</div>

<p>
We will add to this the musings of an anonymous
American writer<a name='FA_163' id='FA_163' href='#FN_163' class='fnanchor'>[163]</a> in the <i>North American Review</i> for
the following year (1840):
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It must have been with mingled and varied feelings that
Audubon published his concluding volume. He was sure then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
that he had raised an imperishable monument to commemorate
his own renown. All anxieties and fears which overshadowed
his work in its beginning had passed away. The prophecies of
kind but overprudent friends, who did not understand his self-sustaining
energy, had proved untrue; the malicious hope of
his enemies, for even the gentle lover of nature has enemies,—had
been disappointed; he had secured a commanding place
in the respect and gratitude of men; he had secured a treasure
of rich and glowing recollections, to warm his own heart in his
declining years, and to kindle enthusiasm in his children's children....
</p>

<p>
On the other hand he had lost an employment which for
years had kept all the powers of body and mind in healthy
though intense exertion; whatever else he might do, the great
work of his intellectual life was finished.... His trumpet of
victory at the result must have given an uncertain sound,
partly exulting in his success, and partly lamenting that his
great work was finished.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It has often been asked, how many complete sets
of Audubon's folio of <i>The Birds of America</i> were distributed,
and how many are in existence today. No
definite answer can be given to either question. His
final lists, appended to the last volume of his "Biographies"
in 1839, and reproduced in <a href="#appendix_iii">Appendix III</a> to
the present work, gave the number of standing names
as 161 (calling for 166 copies), of which 79 (with 84
copies) pertained to Europe, and 82 were American;
inasmuch as 118 subscribers had dropped off, with incompleted
sets on their hands, this brought the total
number of original patrons at that time to 279, and the
number of copies which had been originally ordered to
284. On the other hand, the following advertisement,
evidently from the hand of Audubon himself, appeared
in <i>The Athenæum</i>, under date of "London, November
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
1, 1837," and was reprinted in America a few weeks
later:<a name='FA_164' id='FA_164' href='#FN_164' class='fnanchor'>[164]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The number of perfect copies at present subscribed for does
not exceed 190, of which upwards of 80 are subscribed for in
America; and the expense of getting them up is so great, that
not more than ten or fifteen copies, above the number subscribed
for, will be prepared.
</p>

<p>
The Establishment necessary for its publication will be
broken up when the last Number is coloured; and any application
for the Work must be made to the Author, 4, Wimpole—street,
London; or Mr. R. Havell, Engraver, 77 Oxford—street,
before the first of May next, as after that time no subscription
can be received.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Assuming that Audubon's final published lists, calling
for 166 copies, were correct, and that ten additional
sets were prepared, this would bring the total original
number known to have been complete to 176, which
agrees with an estimate attributed to Victor Audubon,
who once expressed the belief that "about 175 copies"
were in existence, of which about 80 were in America.<a name='FA_165' id='FA_165' href='#FN_165' class='fnanchor'>[165]</a>
It is probable, however, that of the 118 persons who
allowed their subscriptions to lapse, a number completed
their sets from the residual stock, which must have been
great, though the later plates would be the hardest to
obtain; in this event the number of perfect sets of Audubon's
<i>Birds</i> probably never exceeded 190 or 200.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The proprietor of a well known Philadelphia bookshop<a name='FA_166' id='FA_166' href='#FN_166' class='fnanchor'>[166]</a>
has stated that during his experience as an antiquary,
he has had personal knowledge of forty or fifty
copies of the folio edition of Audubon's <i>Birds</i> in America,
and he thought it probable that a single New England
print dealer, in the course of twenty years, had
broken up thirty or forty volumes for the purpose of
selling the plates. This is not surprising, since from
the sale of a single volume upwards of $1,500 might be
realized in this way, but no reputable dealer would now
think of breaking up an unimpaired set.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ruthven Deane, who has compiled a careful record
of copies of <i>The Birds of America</i> known to exist
in the United States, recorded in 1908 that he had ascertained
the resting-place of seventy-five sets which, with
few exceptions, were complete and in good condition.
"A set in the library of the Mechanics-Mercantile Institute,
San Francisco, California, which had been there
for some thirty years, and another set in the San Francisco
Art Association, presented in 1894 by Mr. Edward
F. Searles, Methuen, Massachusetts, were both destroyed
by the disastrous earthquake and fire which visited
that city April 18, 1906."<a name='FA_167' id='FA_167' href='#FN_167' class='fnanchor'>[167]</a>
</p>

<p>
Audubon's own copy of his <i>Birds</i>, the plates of which
were naturally selected with the greatest care, was sold by
Mrs. Audubon after the death of her last surviving son,
in 1862, to John T. Johnson, of New York, for $1,200;
the subsequent history of these volumes has not been
traced. Havell brought with him to America a copy,
every plate of which is said to have been selected by
himself, and it is undoubtedly one of the finest sets in
existence. It passed from the family's possession to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
hands of the publishers and booksellers, Messrs. C. S.
Francis &amp; Company, of 554 Broadway, New York, who
in 1856 had charge of the sale of all of Audubon's
works,<a name='FA_168' id='FA_168' href='#FN_168' class='fnanchor'>[168]</a> and was later purchased by Dr. W. Gurdon
Russell, of Hartford, Connecticut, who presented it to
Trinity College, July 10, 1900.<a name='FA_169' id='FA_169' href='#FN_169' class='fnanchor'>[169]</a>
</p>

<p>
After recording the facts of the case, so far as they
have been ascertained, the following extract from the
minutes of a meeting of the New York Historical Society,
held October 3, 1865, will be read with interest:<a name='FA_170' id='FA_170' href='#FN_170' class='fnanchor'>[170]</a>

Ireland, Scotland, and France, of which Louis Phillippe

"The following received their copies but never paid

Londonderry, Princess of Hesse Homburg.

"An Irish lord whose name he would not give, took
two copies and paid for neither. Rothschild paid for his
copy, but with great reluctance.

<p>
"He further said that he sold 75 copies in America, 26
in New York and 24 in Boston; that the work cost him
£27,000 and that he lost $25,000 by it.
</p>

<p>
"He said that Louis Phillippe offered to subscribe for
100 copies if he would publish the work in Paris. This
he found could not be done, as it would have required 40
years to finish it as things were then in Paris. Of this
conversation I made a memorandum at the time which I
read over to Mr. Audubon and he pronounced it correct.

</p>
</div>

<p>
As regards the subscription of Rothschild the following
account of his interview with the famous banker has
been recorded by Audubon himself.<a name='FA_172' id='FA_172' href='#FN_172' class='fnanchor'>[172]</a> The naturalist, it
appears, received a letter to Baron Rothschild from the
American banking-house of Prime, Ward &amp; King, and
presented it in the summer of 1834. The banker was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
not in when Audubon and his son, Victor, called upon
him, but "soon a corpulent man appeared, hitching up
his trousers, and a face red with the exertion of walking,
and without noticing any one present, dropped his
fat body into a comfortable chair, as if caring for no one
else in this wide world but himself." When Audubon
presented his credentials, the banker asked: "Is this a
letter of business, or is it a mere letter of introduction?'"
As Audubon had not read the letter, he was obliged to
answer rather awkwardly that he could not tell. "The
banker then opened the letter, read it with the manner
of one who was looking only at the temporal side of
things, and after reading it said, 'This is only a letter of
introduction, and I expect from its contents that you are
the publisher of some book or other and need my subscription.'"
Audubon continues:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Had a man the size of a mountain spoken to me in that
arrogant style in America I should have indignantly resented
it; but where I then was it seemed best to swallow and digest
it as well as I could. So in reply ... I said I should be
<i>honored</i> by his subscription to the "Birds of America." "Sir,"
he said, "I never sign my name to any subscription list, but
you may send in your work and I will pay for a copy of it.
Gentlemen, I am busy, I wish you good morning." We were
busy men, too, and so bowing respectfully, we retired, pretty
well satisfied with the small slice of his opulence which our
labor was likely to obtain.
</p>

<p>
A few days afterwards I sent the first volume of my work
half bound, and all the numbers besides, then published. On
seeing them we were told that he ordered the bearer to take
them to his house, which was done directly. Number after
number was sent and delivered to the Baron, and after eight
or ten months my son made out his account and sent it by
Mr. Havell, my engraver, to his banking-house. The Baron
looked at it with amazement, and cried out, "What, a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
pounds for birds! Why, sir, I will give you five pounds, and
not a farthing more!" Representations were made to him of
the magnificence and expense of the work, and how pleased his
Baroness and wealthy children would be to have a copy; but
the great financier was unrelenting. The copy of the work
was actually sent back to Mr. Havell's shop, and as I found
that instituting legal proceedings against him would cost more
than it would come to, I kept the work, and afterwards sold
it to a man with less money but a nobler heart. What a distance
there is between two such men as Baron Rothschild of
London and the merchant of Savannah!

</p>

<p>
After thirteen years of unmitigated labor, Audubon
could have basked in a fame already secure, and could
have enjoyed, for a time at least, a leisure handsomely
earned. But no sooner had he settled in New York
than he entered upon two formidable tasks: one of
these was the complete revision of his <i>Birds of America</i>,
to be issued with its text in "miniature," as its reduced
form was sometimes described; the other, which he did
not live to see brought to completion, was an elaborate
work on the <i>Quadrupeds of North America</i>, eventually
carried forward in collaboration with the Reverend John
Bachman.
</p>

<p>
In his confident and characteristic manner, Audubon
at once issued a "Prospectus" of both these undertakings.
The more cautious Bachman, in writing on September 13,
1839, to congratulate him upon their safe
return, "in spite of storms, calms, and hurricane," said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I am glad that you are about to do something with regard
to the "<i>Small Edition of Birds</i>." But are you not too fast in
issuing your prospectus of <i>The Birds and Quadrupeds</i>, without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
having numbers of both works, by which the public can
judge of their merits? My idea, in regard to the latter, is
that you should carefully get up, in your best style, a volume
about the size of "Holbrook's Reptiles." This would enable
you to decide on the terms of the book, I think that two thousand
subscribers at $1.00 for each number, might be obtained.
But it must be no half-way affair.
</p>

<p>
The animals have never been carefully described, and you
will find difficulties at every step. Books cannot aid you much.
Long journeys will have to be undertaken. Several species remain
to be added and their habits ascertained. The drawings
you can easily make, if you can procure the specimens. I wish
I had you here, if only for two days. I think that I have
studied the subject more than you have. You will be bothered
with the Wolves and the Foxes, to begin with. I have two new
species of Bats and Shrews to add. The Western Deer are no
joke, and the ever varying Squirrels seem sent by Satan himself,
to puzzle the Naturalists.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is evident from this letter that Audubon was then
intending to proceed with the work on the <i>Quadrupeds</i>
alone and that Bachman's active coöperation was secured
later. On September 15, shortly after his return
to America, he wrote to Thomas M. Brewer on this subject
as follows:<a name='FA_173' id='FA_173' href='#FN_173' class='fnanchor'>[173]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Now that I am about to commence the publication of the
<i>Quadrupeds of North America</i>, I will expect your assistance in
the procuring for me of all such subjects as may easily be
obtained around you. John Bachman is about to give the
whole of his collections and his notes to me; and as I intend
to open a pretty general correspondence in different parts of
the Union, I trust to be enabled to proceed roundly on this
fresh undertaking.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Victor Gifford Audubon, who had preceded his
father to America early in 1839, was married in that
year to Mary Eliza, second daughter of John and Harriet
Bachman. This double union of the two naturalists'
families called forth mutual congratulations, but Bachman,
who was inconsolable at the departure of his children,
preferred to talk of birds: "By that time," said he,
"four or five numbers [of the 'Small Edition of the
Birds'] are published, you may turn over the work to
your sons; but, till then, you should carefully review
every page and plate. The next thing will be to get
subscribers. This would be purgatory to me; but it is
necessary to success. While drumming up subscribers,
you may obtain specimens for the Quadrupeds." When
writing again January 13, 1840, Bachman, whose cooperation
in the proposed work had been sought, continued:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The descriptions in the "Small Edition of Birds" will have
to be abridged—your "<i>worthy friend</i>" and other humbugs may
be left out to advantage. I am not at all surprised at your
success at getting subscribers; but let me say, <i>cities</i> are not
the only places to obtain them. Birds sing and nestle among
the groves of the <i>country</i>—The planters and farmers are the
men to become subscribers. An intelligent planter from the up
country said, a few days ago, that if the right person would
thoroughly canvass the whole State of South Carolina, he
would insure three hundred subscribers to the "Small Work."
<i>Old Jostle</i> would be the man, and when his legs failed, the
<i>Young Jostle</i> should go forward. Get the Editors to notice
your work—this is a puffing world—from the porpoise to the
steamboat.

<p>
When we meet, we shall talk about the partnership in the
quadrupeds. I am willing to have my name stand with yours,
if it will help the sale of the book. The expenses and the profits
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
shall be yours or the boys'. I am anxious to do something
for the benefit of Victor and John, in addition to the <i>treasures</i>
I have given them—and this is all I can do.... Employ
yourself now in drawing every quadruped you can lay your
hands upon. If you can find me a live Ermine, buy it in New
York. I must once more examine and study its change of
<i>pilage</i>.
</p>

<p>
Don't flatter yourself that the quadrupeds will be child's
play. I have studied them all my life. We have much, both in
Europe and America, to learn on this subject. The skulls
and the teeth must be studied, and color is as variable as the
wind; down, down in the earth they grovel, while we, in digging
and studying, may grow old and cross. Our work must be
thorough. I would as soon stick my name to a <i>forged Bank
Note</i> as to a mess of <i>soupmaigre</i>.

<p>
To those who have not seen any portion of Mr. Audubon's
Original Drawings, it may be proper to state, that their superiority
consists in the accuracy as to proportion and outline,
and the variety and truth of the attitudes and positions of the
figures, resulting from peculiar means discovered and employed
by him, and his attentive examination of the objects portrayed,
during a long series of years. Mr. Audubon has not contented
himself with single profile views, but in many instances has
grouped his figures, so as to represent the originals in their
natural avocations, and has placed them on branches of trees
decorated with foliage, blossoms and fruits, or amidst plants
of numerous species—some are seen pursuing their prey in the
air, searching for food amongst the leaves and herbage, sitting
on their nests, or feeding their young; whilst others, of a different
nature, swim, wade, or glide in or over their allotted element.
The insects, reptiles and fishes that form the food of
some of the birds, have now and then been introduced in the
drawings. In nearly every instance where a difference of plumage
exists between the sexes, both male and female have been
represented, and the extraordinary changes which some species
undergo in their progress from youth to maturity, have been
depicted.
</p>

<p>
The plants are all copied from nature, and as many are
remarkable for their beauty, their usefulness, or their rarity,
the Botanist cannot fail to look upon them with delight.
</p>

<p>
The particulars of the plan of the work can be reduced to
the following heads:
</p>

<p>
1. The size of the work is royal octavo, the paper being
of the finest quality.
</p>

<p>
2. The Plates representing the Birds are correctly reduced
from the original drawings, and are coloured in the most careful
manner.
</p>

<p>
3. The work will appear in numbers, on the first and fifteenth
of every month.
</p>

<p>
4. Each number will consist of Five Plates, accompanied
with full descriptions of the habits and localities of the birds,
their anatomy and digestive organs, (with occasionally wood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
cuts representing the latter,) and will be furnished to subscribers
for one dollar, payable on delivery.
</p>

<p>
5. The work will be published in accordance with a scientific
arrangement of the genera and species, and will complete the
Ornithology of our country, it is believed, in the most perfect
manner.

TITLE PAGE OF PAPER COVERS IN WHICH PARTS OF THE FIRST AMERICAN (OCTAVO)
EDITION OF "THE BIRDS OF AMERICA" WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED.
</p>
</div> <!-- /figcenter -->

<p>
The octavo edition of Audubon's <i>Birds</i> began to
appear, in parts, late in 1839, and was in press four
years. It was illustrated with 500 lithographic plates,
which were reduced by John Woodhouse Audubon from
his father's old or new originals, with such changes as
the breaking up of composite plates and other considerations
rendered necessary. Many new flowers and
trees made their appearance in these plates, and seventeen
new birds were added to the last volume; the text
was also greatly improved by the process of addition and
subtraction, as well as by the correction of many errors
which it was then possible to effect: as twelve species
were noticed without figures, this brought the total
number of American birds finally recognized by Audubon
to 507.<a name='FA_175' id='FA_175' href='#FN_175' class='fnanchor'>[175]</a> The first considerable list of American
birds with any pretense to accuracy appeared in <i>Notes
on Virginia</i>, published in 1782, by Thomas Jefferson,
who then named 109 species peculiar to the United
States; William Bartram, in 1791, gave 191; Alexander
Wilson, 278; Wilson and Ord, in 1808-14, 320, and
Charles Bonaparte, in 1825-33, is said to have extended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
the number to 382. The present number of North
American birds, omitting sub-species, admitted to the
third revised edition of the "Check-List," prepared by a
Committee of the American Ornithologists' Union and
published in New York in 1910, is 768. To this is added
a hypothetical list of 26 names, the validity of which is
still in doubt; these embrace Townsend's Bunting—<i>Spiza
townsendi</i> (Audubon); Carbonated Warbler—<i>Dendroica
carbonata</i> (Audubon), Blue Mountain Warbler—<i>Dendroica
montana</i> (Wilson), known only in the
works of Wilson and Audubon; the mysterious Small-headed
"Flycatcher," or Warbler—<i>Musicapa minuta</i>
(Wilson) or <i>Wilsonia</i> (?) <i>microcephala</i> (Ridgway), an
account of which is given in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58983/58983-h/58983-h.htm#Page_226">Chapter XIV</a> and which
is known only in Wilson's and Audubon's works; and
Cuvier's Regulus—<i>Regulus cuvieri</i> (Audubon), which
has never been seen beyond the covers of <i>The Birds of
America</i>, and its descriptive text: "I shot <i>this</i> bird,"
said Audubon, "on my father-in-law's plantation of Fatland
Ford, on the Skuylkill River in Pennsylvania, on
the 8th June 1812, while on a visit to my honoured relative
Mr. William Bakewell.... I have not seen another
since."
</p>

<p>
Audubon was soon canvassing the principal cities for
this work, with what success is shown by the following
letter<a name='FA_176' id='FA_176' href='#FN_176' class='fnanchor'>[176]</a> to his family:
</p>

</p>

<p class="post"><span class="smcap">My dear friends</span>
</p>

<p>
So far so good, but alas! I am now out of numbers to deliver
to my subscribers here. Here! where I expected to procure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
a good number more. This list is composed of excellent
men and all good pay. I have in my pocket upwards of one
hundred names, whom I am assured are likely to subscribe.
Therefor I will not leave Baltimore for some days to come at
least. I forward a copy of this list to Chevalier by the same
mail and yet you may as well inquire if he has received it. More
numbers I must have as soon as possible as all my subscribers
here are anxious about receiving their copies, unfortunately I
had only 90 No. 2. I look upon this list as a capital list. I
have sent Mr. Ridgley of Annapolis a No. 1 and a prospectus,
and expect some names tomorrow evening from that quarter.
</p>

<p>
I will remit money to Phila. and let you know how much
as soon as I can. The box has arrived here safely and tomorrow
or Monday I will deliver Biographies &amp;c. D. Potter
is very ill and poor and yet I hope to get his note before I
leave here.
</p>

<p>
I received a note from dear Jonny dated at Norfolk, all
well and going on. I expect they are at this moment at John
Bachman's. I am fatigued beyond description and had the
misfortune last evening of skinning my shin bones, they bled
profusely however, and I hope will soon get well, though feel
rather sore at this very moment, but I will take care of them.
</p>

<p>
The amount of attention which I have received here is quite
bewildering, the very streets resound with my name, and I
feel quite alarmed and queer as I trudge along. Mess. <i>Meckle</i>,
<i>Oldfield</i> and the Brune family have all assisted me in the most
kind and brotherly manner, indeed I may say that my success
is mostly derived from these excellent persons.
</p>

<p>
I have written to Mr. Mifflins. I feel that Theodore Anderson
will not live long. Mr. Morris has not yet returned
from Annapolis. See that the <i>notice</i> in the Baltimore Patriot
which I sent you yesterday is inserted in the <i>Albion</i>, the <i>New
York Gazette</i> and if possible in the <i>Courrier</i> and <i>Enquirer</i>.
</p>

<p>
I have sent one to Chevalier and another to Dr. Parkman.
I ought to have at this moment 300 copies Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, for
Washington City and really I think it would be better to stop
the publication of the work for <i>one month</i> to effect this. Therefor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
loose no time in urging Mr. Bowen (write to him) and
Chevalier also on this all important subject.
</p>

<p>
If ever I was in want of assistance it is at this moment and
<i>you</i> my dear Victor must be on the alert and second my endeavors
to render you all Happy! I would be delighted to have
a few lines from Mamma and Eliza at the end of your next
letter, which I hope to receive in immediate answer to this, <i>Here</i>.
I have marked all your items in your last letter. Call from time
to time at the Mercantile Library. I am glad you have remitted
to the Rathbone's. Do write to Mr. Hoppenstall and
see the daughter of Capt. Brittan. I was invited last evening
to a great ball, and should have gone had not my accident of
shin bones prevented me. I am told that I would have had some
20 names there.

Recollect that our agents name is Gideon B. Smith and a
most worthy man he is, highly recommended by Robert Gilmor
and others.

To the gratification of Audubon and his friends, the
octavo edition of his <i>Birds of America</i> was an immediate
and great success. Only 300 copies of the plates
of the first number, which was ready on December 3,
1839, were printed, but in little more than a month
300 more were demanded, and the number of plates required
rose steadily until January 9, 1841, when it stood
at 1,475 copies.<a name='FA_177' id='FA_177' href='#FN_177' class='fnanchor'>[177]</a> The total number of subscribers given
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
in Audubon's published lists was 1,198, of which 198
are credited to Boston, 164 to Baltimore, 141 to New
York, sixty-five to Philadelphia, and forty-three to foreign
countries, ten of which went to England; Mr.
George Oates of Charleston subscribed for seven copies.
Such a reception for an expensive work on natural history
was unprecedented in the United States, and has
had few parallels in any country.
</p>

<p>
At the very beginning of this new undertaking, the
hand of disease and bereavement rested heavily on the
Audubon and Bachman families; they were obliged to
see first one and then another of their daughters
swept by the same terrible malady, tuberculosis, to an
early grave. Mrs. John Woodhouse Audubon died at
her old home in Charleston, whither she had gone for
the benefit of her health in the previous winter, on
September 23, 1840, at the age of twenty-three; and
Mrs. Victor Audubon, after a long sojourn in Cuba, and
shortly after returning to her home in New York, died
there on May 25, 1841, at the age of twenty-two. Audubon
was very fond of his daughters-in-law, and his
"beloved Rosy," as Victor's wife was familiarly called,
is said to have been a particular favorite and the life
of his family circle. If work at this time brought no
pleasure, it at least afforded him relief from painful
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
In June, 1840, a boy who lived in Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
mustered up courage to write to the naturalist
and give him an account of a new bird, the Yellow-bellied
Flycatcher, which he and his brother had discovered,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
under the very noses, as it were, of all the ornithologists
in America. With that fine sense of modesty
which characterized the man in after life, for his name
was Spencer Fullerton Baird, he wrote:<a name='FA_178' id='FA_178' href='#FN_178' class='fnanchor'>[178]</a> "You see
Sir that I have taken (after much hesitation) the liberty
of writing you. I am but a boy, and very inexperienced,
as you no doubt will observe from my description of
the Flycatcher."
</p>

<p>
Audubon, who had just returned from the sick-bed
of his daughter-in-law, replied promptly as follows:
</p>

<h4>
<i>Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letter_head">
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>June 13, 1840</i>.
</p>
<p class="post">

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
On my return home from Charleston S. C. yesterday, I
found your kind favor of the 4th inst. in which you have the
goodness to inform me that you have discovered a new species
of fly-catcher, and which, if the bird corresponds to your description,
is, indeed, likely to prove itself hitherto undescribed,
for although you speak of yourself as being a youth, your
style and the descriptions you have sent me prove that an old
head may from time to time be found on young shoulders!
</p>

<p>
I wish you would send me one of the stuffed specimens as
well as the one preserved in spirits, and wish you also to rest
assured that if the little <i>Muscicapa</i> stands as a nondescript
that I shall feel pleased to name it after your friend.
</p>

<p>
I have never seen a male of the Cape May warbler with
the upper part of the head pure black. Have you compared
the <i>Regulus</i> with the description of <i>Regulus Cuvieri</i>? Could
you not send me your bird to look at? Being on the eve of
publishing the Quadrupeds of our Country, I have thought
that you might have it in your power to procure several of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
smaller species for me, and thereby assist me considerably.
Please write to me again soon, as I must resume my travels in
8 or 10 days. Have you seen a copy of the small edition of
The Birds of America which I am now publishing? Believe
me, dear sir,

<span class="smcap i8">John J. Audubon</span>

</div>

<p>
Thus began a correspondence between the youth of
fifteen and the veteran of fifty-five, which led to an
intimate friendship that lasted during Audubon's active
career, and was an undoubted stimulus to young Baird,
whose talents, enthusiasm and industry were quickly appreciated
by the older naturalist. Baird answered Audubon's
letter on June 20, and proffered his services
in collecting mammals, saying that while they were more
difficult to find than birds, he hoped "by increased exertion
to make up the difference"; he also added: "I have
seen some numbers of your work now publishing, and
admire them very much. I have no doubt that it will do
more to spread a love of Natural history, than any work
ever published. For my part I read the description of
birds and the episodes in your <i>Ornithological Biography</i>
with the same motive of pleasure as I used to read a
favorite novel." In Audubon's immediate reply of the
22nd, he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is impossible at present for me to give you any precise
idea of the work on our quadrupeds which I have in contemplation
to publish, any further than to say to you, that it
is my intention, as well as that of my friend, the Rev<span class="sup">d</span> John
Bachman, of Charleston, S. C., assisted by several others of
our best naturalists, to issue a work on the Mammalia of North
America worthy of the naturalist's attention, both at home and
abroad.—Through our joint efforts, and assisted as we hope
and trust to be, by numerous friends and acquaintances in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
different portions of our Wide Union, we expect to collect,
not only new species, but much of valuable matter connected
with their geographical range, and particular habits. For
instance, in your assistance in this department as well as in
ornithology, you may be able to send us valuable intelligence
respecting the Shrews, Mice, Rats, Squirrels, etc., found in
your immediate vicinity &amp;c.—and by saving and forwarding
specimens to us, be able also, in all probability, to place into
our hands, objects never before known to the World of Science.
Whatever information we thus receive is sacredly published
under the name of the friend from whom we receive the information,
etc. I have sent you the Zoological report of Doc<span class="sup">r</span>.
De Kay. His <i>Corvus cocolotle</i> [cacolotl] is really our Raven.
<i>Supposed</i> by some inexperienced European naturalists to be
distinct from the Raven of Europe, which, however, is a gross
error.<a name='FA_179' id='FA_179' href='#FN_179' class='fnanchor'>[179]</a>...
</p>

<p>
The thrush which you have described, and which you kindly
offer to send me, may be new, but perhaps you are not acquainted
with the Turdus Nanus of my work, to which it appears,
if not the same, probably a new variety! <i>Nous verrons</i>....
</p>

<p>
Please to collect all the Shrews, Mice, (field or wood), rats,
bats, Squirrels, etc., and put them in a jar in common Rum,
not whiskey, brandy or alcohol. All of the latter spirits are
sure to injure the subjects.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon, who was now "killing two birds with one
stone"—collecting subscribers for one work and mammals
for another, had found a strong and willing helper
in the young naturalist of Carlisle. On December 10 of
the same year Baird wrote that he had discovered another
Flycatcher, as well as a small Woodpecker, which
was apparently new, and had shot a "Bay Lynx or Wild
Cat a mile &amp; a quarter from Carlisle; the cat ... was
2½ feet long &amp; weighed 12½ pounds.... It was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
source of great regret," said Baird, "that I was not able
to meet you in Philadelphia when I was there during
the latter part of September. I saw Mr. Chevalier<a name='FA_180' id='FA_180' href='#FN_180' class='fnanchor'>[180]</a>
several times, and found him a very agreeable gentleman."
Audubon replied to this letter on Christmas
Day, as follows:
</p>

</p>
<p class="post">

<span class="smcap">My dear sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
On my return yesterday from a tour of a month, I found
your kind favor of the 10th inst. at my house. I regret exceedingly
that you and I should not have met at Philadelphia,
as I feel sure by the style and contents of your letters to me
that you are fond of the study of natural objects, as much
as I am.
</p>

<p>
I have no doubt that your journey during the last summer
and autumn was a pleasing one to you, as I can well conceive
from the fresh recollections of my many rambles.
</p>

<p>
You would oblige me much by sending me (through Mr.
Chevelier) the <i>Muscicapa</i> you obtained Oct. 12th, and also the
small woodpecker "with the very broad bill". I am anxious to
see those birds, and will take especial care of them, and also
return them to you, free of all expense.
</p>

<p>
I cannot at this moment return to the specimens you have
already sent me, but in my next letter, I will assure you of the
names of the subjects. I wish I could see your Bay Lynx, as I
feel somewhat confident that we have more than two species
within our limits.
</p>

<p>
Your anecdote connected with the sagacity of the Weasel
is quite pleasing to me, and will appear in my biographies of
quadrupeds bye and bye. I cannot, as yet, give you any estimate
of my work on the Quadrupeds of our Country but will
do so as soon as possible. With my best wishes, for your health
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>

Your letter, and also that of your son, are now before me,
both received so long ago as the middle of last year—how
time flies with those who are fully occupied—I reproach myself
for having allowed them to remain so long unanswered—and
hope my numerous avocations, which absorb my whole time,
will be admitted as my excuse. I see M<span class="sup">r.</span> B. Phillips every

from his hands the first 17 N<span class="sup">os</span> of your smaller American Birds

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
work I make myself content with the small one, and shall be
happy to receive the continuation—pray tell me to whom shall
I make payment for them, shall it be to M<span class="sup">r.</span> Phillips if so, let
me or him know, and it shall be done immediately—I am quite
of your opinion that there would be some sale for it here—if
it was advertised and made known, but a commission of 10.
p cent will not tempt any London Bookseller who is sufficiently
known and influential to be of any service to you—I exhibited
my numbers at the meetings of the Linnean and Zoological
Socities and gave the loose plates between them to lay on the
table, but without the name of a London Bookseller on the
cover no one knows where to get the work if Desirous of buying
it.

I will now answer your inquiries for English Friends. Earl
Derby remains much the same—very well in health, but deprived
of the use of one side entirely, limbs as well as body—unable
to attend to other things, he appears to devote himself
almost entirely to Zoology—Thomson his Superintendent
of the Aviary is at this time in London buying some new or rare
pheasants lately arrived here from China—and will have a
valuable addition to the stock to take back with him—Lord
Derby came to London by the Rail Road last March (1840)
and Thomson tells me, his Lordship means to come up again
this Spring. The Prince of Musignano now P. of Canino I
hear of by report from others—He is quite well, continually
publishing, and we hear that he means to visit London in the
course of the present year—of M<span class="sup">r.</span> Lear we hear the most
satisfactory accounts—generally through M<span class="sup">r.</span> Hullmandill—he
is greatly improved in health and finances—a favorite with
every body, patronized by all who go there—and he too, we
hear, means to visit England in the course of the present year.
M<span class="sup">r.</span> Gould returned safe to England in August last, after an
absence of two years and 8 months—Two years of the time were
passed on Van Diemans land and various parts of New Holland—he
did not go to New Zealand—He has brought home a very
large collection of Birds, with, in many cases, the eggs and
nests—He has commenced the publication of the Birds on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
same scale as his Birds of Europe, but improved in execution—two
parts are out: it is to be published every three months.
I sent off a letter this day to your Edinburgh friend M<span class="sup">r.</span> MacGillivray—he
is a candidate for the Professorship of Natural
History in the Marischall College of Aberdeen and wrote to
ask me for a testimonial of recommendation—this was the
object of my letter to him.—My second volume of the British
Birds will be complete in July next, I will send it to you in
one lump. Pray remember me to your good lady and thank
your son Victoire for me for his letter. I hope you are all well,
and with best wishes for a continuance to you of all that is
good—I remain very sincerely yours

Spencer Baird and his brother, William, were soon
able to announce another discovery, now well known
the country over as the Least Flycatcher, and in some
sections by the onomatopœic name of Chebec. In referring
to it in his letter of June 21, 1841, Baird wrote:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
There is one flycatcher respecting which we are in doubt,
and which was very abundant this spring. It is the one we had
considered <i>M. Pusilla</i> but a thorough examination of the Biography,
has thrown doubt on this supposition, it agrees pretty
well with the <i>M. Acadica</i> of Nuttall, but not with the <i>Acadica</i>,
of the Synopsis. I will send you one as soon as possible, as
there is no set of Plates in Carlisle to which we might refer.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In conclusion Baird added: "May we not expect to
see you in Carlisle before a great while? It would give
us very great pleasure indeed."
</p>

<p>
Though Audubon gladly admitted this new-found
species of bird at a later day, he was not at first disposed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
to accept its validity, as will appear in the following
interesting letter which he sent to his young friend:

</p>

<p>
I have not had time to answer your interesting favor of
the 21st until this morning, being now constantly engaged in
the figuring, &amp;c., of the Quadrupeds of Our Country; by which
I mean that I actually work from daylight every day until
I retire to my necessary repose at night.
</p>

<p>
Your observations upon the birds of passage the last
spring are what they have been almost throughout the U. S.
The very backward spring which we have experienced this year
did no doubt retard the coming into the States the millions of
passenger birds that come to us from beyond our limits. The
Fly-catcher of which you are in doubt is nevertheless the
<i>M. Pusilla</i>, and you must not be surprised to find <i>perhaps</i>
some discrepancy between the specimens you have procured and
the descriptions you may have read, as among mine these
differences are quite obvious and belonging to either sex or age,
as is indeed the case with most of our birds as well as among
many of our quadrupeds....
</p>

<p>
I cannot at present tell you when I may have the pleasure
of meeting you at your own domicile, and yet this may happen
quite unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>
Do you pay attention to the quadrupeds around you? If
not, I wish you would!—and moreover I should be highly
pleased to hear of your procuring for us all such as may be
found in your vicinity. You have <i>Bats, Wood Rats, &amp; Mice,
Weasels, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i>, all of which I should like to possess specimens
at your hands. Could you not save all that you come
across with in this way, place them in <i>common good Rum</i>, and
forward them to me at once or as soon as you have some 2
or three species. I will most cheerfully pay all expenses to
Philadelphia addressed to <i>J. B. Chevalier</i>, No. 70 Dock Street.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I am now as anxious about the publication of the Quadrupeds
as I ever was in the procuring of our Birds, indeed my
present interest in Zoology is altogether bent toward the Completion
of this department of Natural Science.
</p>

<p>
Do please write to me often as I am always glad to hear
from you, and when I am somewhat slow in answering your letters,
be assured that it is altogether on a/c of the excess of
Labour that I have to go through.

Although Audubon never went to Carlisle, young
Baird, as we shall see, repeatedly visited him in New
York and became a favorite with his family. A description
of the new Flycatchers was published by the
Baird brothers in 1843, and represented Spencer's first
contribution to his favorite science; Audubon included
their discovery in the Appendix to the seventh and last
volume of <i>The Birds of America</i> in 1844.

Audubon's occupations in the summer of this year

<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend.</span>—
</p>

<p>
I intended having written to you yesterday by Miss
Shatuck, who was good enough to spend the day with us, but
I was so deeply engaged on a drawing of Rocky Mountain
Flying Squirrels, that the time of her departure came suddenly
and I could merely ask of her to say to you, that your last
letter and remittance had reached us in safety, and with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
unexampled promptness shewn by you on the three occasions
you have been troubled with the delivery of 46 parts of our
work to 46 of our Boston subscribers; and for which as I
have said before I am very sorry to have nought but our sincerest
thanks and gratitude to you for this, so remarkable, proceeding.
May God reward you and yours for all your generous
actions.
</p>

<p>
I thank you also for your memorandums about the quadrupeds
in the Boston Museum as I see that our animal there
may save me the trouble of going to the State of Maine for it.
When I was last under the hospitable roof of our Friend Doc<span class="sup">r</span>
Shattuck, I saw in George's room a N<span class="sup">o.</span> of the "Penny Magazine"
in which there is a plate representing a family of Beavers
at work, that reminded me greatly of what I have seen in the
ponds of Indiana some thirty years ago, and which I should like
to have for a few days to assist in part in the making of the
background to my Drawing of these animals, drawn from the
Individual you procured for me. I will take good care of the
N<span class="sup">o.</span> and will return it safely very soon.
</p>

<p>
Should George Shattuck have forwarded that N<span class="sup">o.</span> to M<span class="sup">r.</span>
B. of Baltimore, pray ask him to write to the later to
send it to me as soon as convenient. If per chance you
could procure for me a live <i>Hare in the Summer dress</i> (It is
pure white in winter) pray do so and do not mind the price or
the cost of its conveyance to me. This animal is abundant in
the northern portions of your State and is fully double the
size of the common <i>Hare</i> called the "Rabbit."
</p>

<p>
With sincerest regards and kindest remembrances to all
around you and our mutual Friends,

<p class="post">
The "Parkman Wren"<br />
well mounted will soon be<br />
on your chimney mantle!
</p>
</div>

<p>
The unique specimen of the little Wren, referred to
in the postscript of this letter, had been discovered on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
the Columbia River by Dr. Townsend some years before,
and though Audubon had described it in 1839, his
figure of it had but just appeared; this was doubtless
included, as Mr. Thayer remarks, in the parts of the
octavo edition of <i>The Birds of America</i>, which Dr.
Parkman distributed at Boston in the summer of this
year.
</p>

<p>
As an indication of the zeal and energy with which
Audubon undertook his work on the quadrupeds, the
following letter (dated "New York, August 15, 1841,"
and addressed to "W. O. Ayres,<a name='FA_183' id='FA_183' href='#FN_183' class='fnanchor'>[183]</a> Esq., Miller's Place,
Suffolk county, Long Island, New York") will be read
with interest:

<p>
I am now closely engaged in conjunction with my friend the
Revd. John Bachman—of Charleston, S. C., in the preparing
of a work on the viviparous quadrupeds of North America,
and I have already drawn about one hundred figures of these,
including thirty-six species.
</p>

<p>
Now knowing the interest you feel towards the advancement
of Natural Science, in every department, I have thought
that should you assist us in the procuring specimens, whether
in the flesh or skin, dead or alive; that we would be much benefitted
by such aid.—Long Island possesses rare and valuable
species, and although many of them are plentiful they are
rarely procured unless accidentally as it were. In your Rambles
after the feathered Tribe, you surely come across at times
with quadrupeds, and if you were good enough to shoot them
or to catch them and send them to me in the manner mentioned
below, I personally would feel extremely obliged to you.
</p>

<p>
Bats, Wood Rats and Wood Mice, Shrews, Shrew Moles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
and all the smaller animals can be forwarded in an earthern
jar immersed in good Yankee Rum.—The larger kinds can be
skinned, preserving the skull entire, and also the legbone and
the clavicles. One fore &amp; one hind foot ought to be pinned
on a board or cork until perfectly dried, and actual measurements
and weights forwarded with the specimens. Nos. accordingly
with the notes of localities and dates. Young and old
are wanted. The Cat Squirrel is now and then procured about
you of a very large size—the Woodchuck &amp;c. but it is unnecessary
for me to give you a list as we are anxious to procure
every thing we can from every portion of the Union with the
view to ascertain their geographical range.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The expense involved in producing the early numbers
of the small edition of his <i>Birds</i> must have been
great, and Audubon was feeling the strain, when the
letter,<a name='FA_184' id='FA_184' href='#FN_184' class='fnanchor'>[184]</a> dated "New York—April 29, 1841," from which
the following extract is taken, was sent to his Boston
agent: "I doubt much if you are <i>actually aware</i> that
we have at this moment in this city and at Philadelphia
upwards of <i>Seventy</i> persons employed upon the present
work, and that all these ... are to be paid regularly
each Saturday evening, and that <i>when we are out of
temper</i> it is not without cause."
</p>

<p>
When Baird visited the Audubons, in New York, in
January, 1842, he was fascinated by the masterly drawings
of birds and quadrupeds which were then being
produced, and was determined to pay more attention
himself to an art for which presumably he had little
natural aptitude; he seems also to have received a hint
for the improvement of his somewhat loose chirography.
Upon leaving, Audubon presented his pupil with a
copy of the <i>Biography</i> of Birds. After returning to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
home, Baird wrote from Carlisle, on February 8 of
that year:
</p>

<h4>
<i>Spencer Fullerton Baird to Audubon</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
After a trial of two weeks I begin to find that I am getting
over the shock caused by the sudden transition from the bustle
of Broadway to the lifelessness of Carlisle, and hope that by
the application of the proper means I may in time perfectly
recover. Philadelphia seemed dull but Carlisle was death itself.
My visit now however seems but as a dream, and I have
settled down into my old regular monotonous life as if I had
never been absent a day. When I arrived my friends had a
great many questions to ask of course, but almost the first ones
on every lip were about Mr. Audubon,—how he looked? What
was his age, whether the idea they had formed of him from
his writings was correct, many queries also were respecting
Mrs. A. and her sons; and they all said that they would
be ever grateful to them for their kindness, to one away from
home....
</p>

<p>
For want of other objects I have commenced to draw the
sternal and shoulder apparatus of our birds, a pretty large
collection of which I have been making for a year past....
Have you heard from Mr. Lyon of Bedford yet about the
money he owes you? I was asking about him the other day,
of an acquaintance of his, who told me that he was as good as
gold in all his debts, &amp; expressed some surprise at his not having
paid, as he generaly is very punctual.... Last week I walked
up to Pinegrove an iron works about sixteen miles in the mountains
where resides the Mr. Ege I have so often spoken about
as the mighty Nimrod of our county. On my arrival I found
a fine wild cat hanging in the stable which had been killed a
few days before. On returning the next day I took the cat
with me slung across my shoulders, and on reaching home
after measuring &amp; weighing it skinned it. I am in hopes of
getting some more from here, as they promised to catch all
they could for me.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
</p>

<p class="post">
Baird signed himself "Your affectionate pupil," and
added in a postscript: "I forgot to say that I had a
fine steak of the wild cat broiled and it tasted like a
tender piece of fresh pork. I will certainly eat the whole
of the next one obtained. I intend to taste all the Quadrupeds
inhabiting this part of the country."

<p>
It is about half an hour since I had the real pleasure of
receiving your letter of the 8th inst. and my earnest thanks
to you for it and its contents; to all of which I will try to
answer at your request.
</p>

<p>
That beautiful Carlisle, its surrounding hills bordering its
valleys, all within the bosom of quiet nature should appear to
you as a small affair when compared to our largest city in the
Union, is not at all remarkable, but let me ask you the following
questions. Did you meet all your dear Parents and
Friends quite well? Did they not receive you with the kindest
of welcomes? Were not their <i>hearts</i> and feelings towards you
the same as ever? Surely all this was fact, and being so, would
you not after all prefer <i>Little Carlisle</i> than <i>Great New York</i>
with all its humbug, rascality, and immorality? Surely or do
I mistake your nature sadly, you do! It is now a good long
time since I was young, and resided near Norristown in Pennsylvania.
It was then and is now a very indifferent place as
compared with New York; but still my heart and mind oftentime
dwell in the pleasure that I felt there, and it always reminds
me that within a few miles of that village, my Mother<a name='FA_185' id='FA_185' href='#FN_185' class='fnanchor'>[185]</a>
did live, and it was there also that my good fortune led me to
know and to marry the excellent Wife I have yet, at whose
hands yourself have tried to be rendered comfortable. Say
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
what you will. "there is nothing like home"... I wish I could
be with you, if only for one week, for then I imagine that
between your friends of the mountains, yourself, and myself,
we could Tree a "Catamount" and soon untree him. The tugging
part of that far-famed animal, I would cheerfully give
up to your youthful shoulders, but not so with the figuring of
it, yet for a while. Is there such a Beast in existence? Do let
me know as soon as you can. I am heartily glad that you have
procured a wild cat from the mountainous part of Pennsylvania,
and that you have preserved its skin, which I beg you to
forward as soon as you please, along with whatever other
quadrupeds you may have in hand, that we may say more on
those Beasts of the Central States, than has ever been before
told....
</p>

<p>
<i>Look out for Martens</i>, and try to find me some youself!
I am glad that you find wild cat meat pretty good, as it
corroborates the sayings of many others, who pronounce it
equal to young veal.
</p>

<p>
Let me say to you ("en passant") that your handwriting
is considerably improved, and depend upon it that your attention
<i>to Drawing</i> will soon enable you as of "copper plate."
Go ahead!

I now wish you earnestly to offer our joint respects, regards,
and best wishes to all your family and friends, and to

P. S. Thank you for what you say of the Bedford gentleman.
When I write next, I will mention him at greater length. I
wish you could let me know whether we could procure first rate
peach trees from your vicinity, and how much 50 of them would
cost. I should like to have them assorted, soft, and clings
yellow, or red, or blood-red. We wish to plant these as early
in March as possible, if young trees, two years old could be
had, we might, perhaps, have fruit on some of them during the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>

<p>
Audubon, who ever found city life irksome, as early
as 1841 had begun to look about for a farm, or some
retired spot within easy access to New York, where he
could establish the families of himself, of his two sons,
and have about him many of the animals which he then
wished to study and depict for his new work. Edward
Harris would have been glad to have had him for a
neighbor, and wrote from Moorestown, New Jersey, on
July 5, 1841, suggesting that he examine "a small farm
close to <i>his</i> village, containing about 25 acres of very
good land," which the owner was then willing to sell
for $3,500, though, added Harris, "when Mr. Havell
was here, he asked $5,000 for it." A spot more to his
liking, however, was found on the Hudson River, in
Carmansville, later known as Washington Heights,
where he purchased from thirty to forty acres of land
which had a river frontage of a thousand feet, from the
present One Hundred and Fifty-fifth to One Hundred
and Fifty-eighth Streets, and extended to the easterly
limits of the village at the old Bloomingdale Road, near
the present Amsterdam Avenue. This tract was well
wooded, and among the grand forest trees on the
place a large tulip or white wood attracted general
attention from its great girth and commanding height.
Audubon decided to place his house at the foot of the
river bluff, amid a cluster of fine oaks, chestnuts and
evergreens, and a clearing had to be made before the site
could be laid off; it was some years before the railroad
came to mar his river view and interrupt access to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
beach. Audubon began to build in 1841, and on February
24, 1842, Victor wrote to Edward Harris: "Our
house in the country is going on well, and will probably
be ready for us in about two months. John is at work
out there every day"; they were planning, he said, to
raise pigs and poultry, and he inquired after "draining
tiles, such as are made near Philadelphia."
</p>

<p>
Audubon named his new estate "Minnie's Land,"
in honor of his wife, Lucy, to whom he deeded the property,
the Scotch form of her name having no doubt come
into familiar use during their residence abroad. In
April, 1842, they turned their backs on the city and occupied
their new home. Spencer Baird, when writing
on May 3 of that year, said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have been in some doubt where this letter should be addressed,
since "86 White St." will not reach you, and you
must by this time be snugly fixed I hope in your beautiful
place up the River. Do not laugh therefore if I prefix "Formerly"
to the old superscription....
</p>

<p>
I suppose that the First Number of the "Quadrupeds of
North America" is out by this time, I hope that it will be
hailed by a large list of subscribers, and will do what I can
for this desirable end.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Submerged as Audubon was, with painting the
<i>Quadrupeds</i>, keeping the small edition of his <i>Birds</i> in
motion, and canvassing for subscribers to both works,
which he published himself, he nevertheless found time
for an extraordinary number of letters, which were
written with an elegance of chirography that diverts
our attention from their orthographic defects. In the
labor of drawing and in all his business affairs he was
constantly aided by his sons.
</p>

<p>
In Audubon's time the center of Carmansville was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
a quarter of a mile to the east of his house, while at a
short distance below, on the river, lay Manhattanville,
at the present One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street,
from which men frequently came on summer evenings
to help handle the seine, fish then being plentiful in that
part of the Hudson. The place came to possess a good
garden and orchard, with stable, dairy, and poultry
yards; enclosures also were made for deer, elk, wolves,
foxes and other wild animals. The old barn of the Audubon
place stood higher on the slope where the naturalist
built his studio or painting house, but no traces of
either now exist. Though standing low, the house commanded
a wide sweep of the river with the Palisades
on its opposite shore, and such attractive surroundings
were a never failing source of delight and inspiration to
the naturalist to his dying day.
</p>

worked on an average fourteen hours a day, preparing a work
on the Quadrupeds of America, similar to his work on the
Birds. The drawings already finished, of the size of life, are
master-pieces in their way, surpassing if that be possible, in
fidelity and brilliancy, all that he has done before. Early in
the summer he will depart to continue his labors in the woods.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
add that at this time Audubon was in his fifty-eighth
year, and not over sixty, as this writer surmised. After
passing beyond the outposts of the city of that day, and
turning into a rustic road which led directly to the river,
his walk
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
soon brought a secluded country house into view,—a house not
entirely adapted to the nature of the scenery, yet simple and
unpretending in its architecture, and beautifully embowered
amid elms and oaks. Several graceful fawns and noble elk
were stalking in the shade of the trees, apparently unconscious
of the presence of a few dogs, and not caring for the numerous
turkeys, geese, and other domestic animals that gabbled and
screamed among them....
</p>

<p>
"Is the master at home?" I asked of the pretty maid-servant
who answered my tap at the door, and who after informing
me that he was, led me into a room on the left side of the
broad hall. It was not, however, a parlor, or any ordinary reception-room
that I entered, but evidently a room for work. In
one corner stood a painter's easel, with a half-finished sketch of
a beaver on paper; in the other lay the skin of an American
panther. The antlers of elks hung upon the walls, stuffed
birds of every description of gay plumage ornamented the mantle-piece;
and exquisite drawings of field-mice, orioles, and
woodpeckers were scattered promiscuously in other parts of
the room, across one end of which a long rude table was
stretched to hold artist materials, scraps of drawing paper and
immense folio volumes filled with the delicious paintings of
birds taken in their haunts.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The master, who soon appeared,
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
was a tall, thin man, with a high arched and serene forehead,
and a bright penetrating gray eye; his white locks fell in clusters
upon his shoulders, but were the only signs of age, for
his form was erect, and his step as light as that of a deer. The
expression of his face was sharp, but noble and commanding,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
and there was something in it, partly derived from the aquiline
nose and partly from the shutting of the mouth, which made
you think of the imperial eagle.
</p>

<p>
His greeting, as he entered, was at once frank and cordial,
and showed you the sincere and true man. "How kind it is,"
he said with a slight French accent, and in a pensive tone, "to
come and see me; and how wise, too, to leave that crazy city!"
He then shook me warmly by the hand. "Do you know," he
continued, "how I wonder that men can consent to swelter and
fret their lives away amid those hot bricks and pestilent vapors,
when the woods and fields are all so near?"
</p>
</div>

<p>
When writing in 1845, Godwin gave further intimations
of the naturalist's appearance: "His forehead
[was] high, arched, and unclouded; the hairs of the
brow prominent, particularly at the root of the nose,
which was long and aquiline; chin prominent, and mouth
characterized by energy and determination. The eyes
were deep-gray, set deeply in the head, and as restless
as the glance of an eagle."

EXPEDITION TO THE UPPER MISSOURI

<p>
In the summer of 1842, when his two new undertakings
were well in hand, Audubon was planning a journey
which he felt would help them both, his long cherished
but ever deferred expedition to the Far West; in
the dim perspective his mind's eye could trace the snowy
summits of the Rocky Mountains, a promised land he
was never destined to see, though, with true poetic justice,
one of those grand peaks now bears his name. At
this time he was in his fifty-eighth year, and although
his family thought him too old for so arduous a journey,
he would not be thwarted, for his eye was undimmed
and his natural force unabated.
</p>

<p>
The letters which passed between Audubon and
Baird at this time show how eager was his young friend
to attach himself to the party. While in Washington,
July 27, 1842, Baird wrote:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
After making several unsuccessful efforts to get a second
sight of you day before yesterday, I was obliged to give up
the attempt in despair. I went to the Capitol at half past
twelve and wandered over the whole building, Library, Senate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
Chamber and House, without being able to see or hear anything
of your excellency. In the evening as in the morning I
was again at Fuller's without avail, went up the street, listened
awhile to the Circus music, came back, you were in bed.
</p>

<p>
One thing I wanted to ask you about, was respecting your
proposed trip next spring.... Nothing would delight me
more than to go, if I can afford it. Next what preparation
would I have to make to fit myself to accompany you. The
journey ought to be a sort of "Humboldt &amp; Bonpland" one, for
the purpose of increasing the general sum of knowledge in
every department of science, physical as well as natural....
If there is anything I can do for you here, do not hesitate to
command me.

<p class="post">

<span class="smcap">My Dear Young Friend</span>,—
</p>

<p>
Your letter of the 27th Inst. reached me yesterday. I am
truly vexed that I should have missed you at the Library or
the Congress Chambers, where I went (perhaps too late) between
3 and 4 o'clock of the afternoon, having been detained
at the different Departments of State where it was my duty to
call, preparatory to the next coming Great Western Journey.
</p>

<p>
Now it proves by your letter that you feel favorably disposed
to accompany me on this long thought-of and contemplated
Tour, and wish me to give you some idea of the expenses,
attached to such an undertaking; but to this question I am
quite unable to reply at present, although I may do so in a
few weeks, and which I shall do, provided you write to me
again on the subject.
</p>

<p>
I have no very particular desire to embark as deep in the
Cause of Science as the great Humboldt has done, and that,
simply because I am too poor in pecuniary means and too incompetent;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
but I wish nevertheless <i>to attempt</i> to open the
Eyes of naturalists to <i>Riches untold</i>, and <i>facts hitherto untold</i>.
The portions of the country through which it is my intention
to pass, never having been trodden by white Man previously.
</p>

<p>
I have some very strong doubts whether the results of the
Antarctic Expedition will be published for some time yet; for,
alas, our Government has not the means, at present, of paying
some <i>half a Million of Dollars</i> to produce publications such
as they should publish, and connected with the vast stores of
Information, collected by so many Scientific Men in no less
than Four Years of Constant Toil and privation, and which
ought to come to the World of Science at least as brightly as
the brightest rays of the Orb of Day during the Mid-summer
Solstice. Oh, my dear young friend, that I did possess the
wealth of the Emperor of Russia, or of the King of the French;
then, indeed, I would address the Congress of our Country, ask
of them to throw open these stores of Natural Curiosities, and
Comply with mine every wish to publish, and to <i>Give away</i> Copies
of the invaluable Works thus produced to every Scientific
Institution throughout our Country, and throughout the
World.
</p>

<p>
As you however appear desirous to present my thoughts
of your capabilities as one of the assistants in that Stupendous
undertaking, I send you enclosed what I hope most sincerely
may prove beneficial for such purposes.
</p>

<p>
Now as you have been kind enough to offer me your services
at Washington, I ask you to call upon Mr. Cushing, M. C., of
Mass.tts, and to ask him to have the goodness to forward me
the Letter promised me by the President of the U. S., for, as
I have not yet had it, I somewhat fear that it has been missent.

Audubon enclosed with this letter a warm recommendation
of his friend for the position of curator of

the rich collections made by the United States Exploring
Expedition to the Antarctic, under command of
Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, then stored at the Patent
Office and National Institute, but nothing came of it
and Baird went away disappointed.
</p>

<p>
During the summer, in accordance with his usual
custom, Audubon had taken pains to fortify himself
with credentials from the Government, and had obtained
excellent letters from President John Tyler, Daniel
Webster, Secretary of State, General Winfield Scott,
who then held the highest commission in the Army, John
C. Spencer, Secretary of War, and Lord Ashburton, a
member of a special commission to settle the disputed
boundary between Maine and the British provinces. The

I have just returned from a visit to the country, where I

On September 12 Audubon set out on a canvassing
tour of Canada, on which he went as far north as Quebec;
as he passed his home, he hailed his sons, who were
sailing on the river, and the sight of them at this moment
brought tears to his eyes. Whitehall, New York, was
reached on September 13, St. Johns, Canada, on the
following day, and on the 15th he was in Montreal;
three days were spent at Quebec (September 16-18),
where, as at other points, he met with the most gratifying
success. After reaching home in October, the following
glowing account of this tour and of the attractions
of his new estate on the Hudson was given in a
letter to Dr. Benjamin Phillips of London,<a name='FA_191' id='FA_191' href='#FN_191' class='fnanchor'>[191]</a> dated
from "New York, 7th Nov., 1842":

I went on a tramp to the Canadas, leaving our comfortable
abode on the 12th of Sepr. last and was absent for a whole
month. My Journey extended to something like 1500 miles:
during which I visited for the first time, the North-American
Gibralter [Quebec], the sight of which was as new to me as
it was wonderful in the days of old. The views (for I must
speak in the plural) from the Citadel, are as far as I have seen
the grandest and the most sublime I ever gazed upon. The
St. Laurence River, is noble indeed, and when we know that
that stream carried forth to the Atlantic the congregating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
waters of all our sea-lakes, we must not be astonished at her
great breadth, depth, and strength of current to about 60
miles below Montreal. About the latter city that noble stream
is intercepted by many rapids, and a vast number of Islands,
the latter of which so intersect the view that in some instances
it would prove quite out of the question to discover with certainty
either of the main shores. I visited the falls of Montmorency,
those of the Rivierre Serria and of La Chan[u]diere.
I besides made many an acquaintance and a few very valuable
friends. At Quebec I sold a copy of our large Work to the
Earl of Caledon who also subscribed to our quadrupeds. At
Montreal I sold several Copies of our Small Edition of the
Birds of America and procured several good names to the
quadrupeds. At Kingston where I had the pleasure of becoming
acquainted with Sir Charles Bagot and family (all delightful
persons) I sold two copies of the large work to both Houses
of Parliament, and also procured their double subscriptions to
the Animals. Thus I returned home highly pleased with all that
I had done and seen. The more perhaps because I procured in
the meantime most valuable specimens of rare quadrupeds and
a fund of information that can never be met with unless on
the ground of action....
</p>

<p>
Our dear "Minnie's Land" is improving as fast as our poor
pecuniary means will allow. We have done a good deal since
our purchase of it, in a wild state as it was, and next spring
we will have a good garden and probably some fruit from our
own young trees, of which we have planted nearly 200 of the
very best description, including pears, aples, quinces, apricote,
plumbs, vines, nectarines, apricotes, etc., etc.... We have
fish whenever we draw the seine, and this summer we have caught
one sturgeon that measured upwards of 8 feet ... weight
more than 200 pounds.... The "Boys" take a sailing pretty
frequently in their sail boat, but I never join them in that, for
attempts I have crossed the Atlantic pretty frequently I have
an inward dislike to the water, after it is more than 2 or 3
fathoms deep! We have now been enjoying that delightful
season, which our Americans call the "Indian Summer" and not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
a drop of rain have we had for several weeks.... Would that
you all were here at this moment, at my elbow, from which
by a peep at the window, I gaze on the "Pallisades" and the
breath of the Hudson, between the trunks of the many trees
that stand at rest at present awaiting the return of spring for
a renewal of fragrant verdure, and fruits innumerable....
</p>

<p>
We would be glad if you would ascertain whether a good
agent can be had to procure subscribers in England for it
[the <i>Quadrupeds</i>], or whether a responsible bookseller would
buy the copyright, &amp; a certain number of plates either coloured
or plain.

A few weeks later Audubon wrote also to William
Yarrell, hoping to interest him in the foreign sale of
his new publication, but as will be seen by his friend's
reply, now to be given, with indifferent success:

<span class="smcap">My dear M<span class="sup">R.</span> Audubon</span>,
</p>

<p>
I have this morning received your letter of the 28<span class="sup">th.</span> Nov<span class="sup">r.</span>
last, and as it is strictly a letter of business, I reply to its
various parts immediately.
</p>

<p>
About a month ago I received a note from M<span class="sup">r.</span> Phillips to
say that he had received the Plates of the first number of your
work on the Quadrupeds of America—would I come and look
at them, and would I exhibit them at the meetings of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
Societies I belonged to for the promotion of Natural History.
I went to see them, and have with pleasure exhibited them at
the Linnean Society on the third Tuesday in Nov<span class="sup">r.</span> and at the
Scientific evening, as well as the monthly general meeting of
the Zoological Society, both of which occurred early in Dec<span class="sup">r.</span>
and I then returned the 5 Plates to M<span class="sup">r.</span> Phillips—They were
very much admired but I did not obtain any request for a
supply.
</p>

<p>
In reference to your next request, I must decline any connection
with the sale or publication of this, or indeed any other
foreign work, in this country. The truth is, that having now
been in the business nearly forty years, I begin to be tired of
work; the last part of my History of British Birds will be published
on the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of June 1843; with that part I shall give up
my pen, and write for money no more.
</p>

<p>
You are kind enough to give me some credit for experience
as a publisher, and some knowledge of the persons who
are likely to be purchasers of works on Natural History here—My
conviction is that you would gain more by paying full commission
to an established Bookseller in London who would by
advertising make your works known, and where they might be
obtained—than you will by the best efforts of any private
friend, even though his kindness should induce him to take all
the trouble for nothing.
</p>

<p>
You say nothing about your family. I hope they are all
well.

able to form a true Idea of what I intend to say [to] you, and
for yourself to give me a true answer, on which I can depend,
no matter whether it is to my liking or not.
</p>

<p>
It is now determined that I shall go towards the Rocky
Mountains at least to the Yellowstone River, and up the latter
Stream four hundred miles, and <i>perhaps</i> go across the Rocky
Mountains. I have it in my power to proceed to the Yellowstone
by Steamer from St. Louis on the 1st day of April next;
or to go to the "<i>Mountains of the Wind</i>" in the very heart and
bosom of the Rocky Mountains in the company of Sir William
Drommond Stewart, Baronet who will leave on the 1st of May
next also from St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
It has occurred to me that perchance you would like to
spare a few months of your life, to visit the great Western
Wilderness, and perhaps again prefer going in my Company
in preference to that of any other person? Of this of course
I cannot Judge without your answer to this. I thought that
you would have been in New York long ere this, but not a Word
of you has reached any friend of yours here for several months.
I have had an abundance of applications from different sections
of the country, from Young Gents who proffer much
efficiency, etc., but I do not know them as I know you, and if
the terms which I am about to propose to you will answer
your own views, I wish you to write to me at once so that
I may know how to prepare myself for such a Journey, and
under such circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Would you like to go with me at any rate? By which I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
mean, whether by Land, or by Water, and undertake, besides
acting towards me as a friend, to prepare whatever skins of
Birds or Quadrupeds, I may think fit for us to bring home.
The Birds, you might have one half as your own, the Quadrupeds,
(should you wish it) you might have a 4<span class="sup">th</span> or every
4<span class="sup">th</span> specimen of the same species, reserving to myself all that
is new or exceedingly rare.
</p>

<p>
I will procure and furnish <i>all the materials</i> for skinning,
preparing, and saving whatever we may find in Ornithology and
in Mammalia, and in all probability (if you think it absolutely
necessary) pay one half your expenses from the time we leave
St. Louis until our return to that city. You will have to work
hard, of course, but then I trust to that the knowledge alone
which you must acquire would prove a sufficient compensation,
and as you already know me pretty well, I need not say to you
that I am not "hard on the trigger."
</p>

<p>
It will be necessary for you to provide a good double
barrelled Gun, and an excellent Rifle, Shot bag, powder flask,
&amp;c, a good hatchet, and a sufficiency of clothes for something
like a 12 month's Campaign. But if you will write me at once
upon the subject, I can give you a more and a better a/c of all
my intentions, than is at present necessary.
</p>

<p>
If all goes on as I trust it will go on, we may be back home
by Oct<span class="sup">r.</span> or Nov<span class="sup">r.</span> next, 1843.
</p>

<p>
Do not lose a moment in writing to me in answer to this
after you have thought <i>deeply</i> upon the matter.
</p>

<p>
Remember me kindly to all your friends, and believe me,
</p>

Baird was unable to reach a decision in the matter,
and Audubon actually wrote five more letters on the
subject and kept a place open for his young friend for
nearly three months. On January 2, 1843, he said that
while it was impossible to determine with any degree of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
accuracy the amount of money the journey might require,
he could "safely say that the sum of $500. would
prove all sufficient, as our passages to the Yellow Stone
will be granted us free; and the expenses from here or
from Carlisle cannot exceed 50$ to St. Louis, and may
be less." "I have given up," he added, "all Idea of
going South this season, being determined to draw
quadrupeds until a few days of my leaving home for this
grand and Last Journey, I intend to make as a Naturalist."
Again, on January 31, he wrote:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It appears from the whole tenure of your letter, that that
rascally article <i>cash</i> is the cause which prevents you from going
along with me to the Yellowstone River and back. Now,
it happens that although we are far from being rich, we are
all desirous that you should go along with me, because we all
know you, and I particularly so. Therefore, if you will go
with me, and assist me all you can, in the way of hunting,
measuring and dissecting Specimens when I am otherwise engaged,
etc. etc. I will furnish you with all that may be necessary
for your expenses, excepting your clothing and your gun
or guns, as you may have them.

In still another letter, of February 10, Audubon said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
That your kind mother should feel great reluctance in the
premises, does not astonish me, as my own good Wife was
much against my going on so long a Journey; but her Strong
Sense of what is best for us all, and as well as in myself, the
perfect confidence that our Maker's Will will be done, she has
now no Scruples of any kind, and as for myself I rely as much
as I ever have done in the Support of the Almighty Being who
has supported and secured me against evils of all sorts in my
Various undertakings, and with this Idea at my heart, I feel
confident that although an Old Man, I could undertake any
Journey whatever, and no matter of their lengths or difficulties.

But I wish you would assure your good mother that to go to
Yellow Stone River, in a good Steamer, as passengers by the
courteous offers of the President of the American Fur Company
who himself will go along with us, that the difficulties that
existed some 30 years ago in such undertakings are now rendered
as Smooth and easy as it is to go to Carlisle and return to
N. Y. as many times as would make up the Sum in Miles of
about 3000: Our difficulties (if any there are) will be felt on
our return; when we must come back to St. Louis in one or 2
open boats in Sep<span class="sup">r</span> and part of Oct<span class="sup">r</span> next. The passage being

<p>
Young Baird would gladly have accompanied Audubon,
but the fears of his friends for his health and
safety interposed, and the party as eventually made up
comprised, beside the naturalist, John G. Bell, as taxidermist,
Isaac Sprague, artist, Lewis Squires, general
assistant and secretary, and his old friend Edward Harris.
</p>

<p>
Audubon left his home on March 11, 1843, with Victor,
who accompanied him as far as Philadelphia, where
a rendezvous was made before starting west. The party
went first to Baltimore, and by steam cars to Cumberland,
then by coach through the Gap, and across the
Alleghanies to Wheeling, where a steamer took them
down river to Cincinnati. On March 19 they reached
Louisville, where Audubon spent four days with his
brother-in-law, William G. Bakewell, and on the 28th
they arrived at St. Louis, where the party completed
their outfit. On April 25 they began their ascent to the
Missouri, in the steamer <i>Magnet</i>, a small vessel belonging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
to the American Fur Company, with a motley crowd
of trappers, employed by the Company, representing
French creoles, Canadian French, Indians, and other
nationalities.
</p>

<p>
During this journey, which lasted eight months, Audubon
kept a voluminous journal, which was written in
a fine hand on large sheets of linen paper that could be
easily rolled and carried in his pocket; this was afterwards
sent to Bachman, was returned, and was lost for
fifty years, or until 1896, when it was recovered from an
old secretary by Audubon's granddaughters, one of
whom published it in 1898.<a name='FA_193' id='FA_193' href='#FN_193' class='fnanchor'>[193]</a> It is a highly interesting
and spirited narrative from beginning to end, and
abounds in graphic pictures of the Indians and trappers,
the military posts and pioneer settlements, the abundant
bird life and big game, the biggest of which, the buffalo,
was then seen by Audubon in a state of nature for
the first time, the grand and turbulent rivers, and the
smiling or frowning face of the great wilderness so
soon to be changed by the devastating hands of civilized
man.
</p>

<p>
What Audubon thought to be a new finch, discovered
near the Snake Hills in Missouri, was named for
Edward Harris, and though it proved to have been previously
described, the bird is still known as "Harris'
Finch"; a few days later a new vireo, <i>Vireo bellii</i>, received
the name of John G. Bell, his taxidermist, and
similar honors were passed to artist Isaac Sprague, to
whom was dedicated the little titlark, <i>Alauda spragueii</i>,
now <i>Anthus spraguei</i>.
</p>

<p>
In those days of river navigation, the frequent tying
up for fuel or necessary repairs, not to speak of grounding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
in a treacherous channel, gave almost daily opportunities
for the hunters to go ashore, and these occasions
seldom failed to produce something interesting,
new, or rare. In the Indian country, at Bellevue,
Nebraska, where they touched to land a part of their
cargo, Audubon "saw a trick of the trade, which made
<i>him</i> laugh. Eight cords of wood were paid for with
five tin cups of sugar and three of coffee—value at St.
Louis about twenty-five cents."
</p>

<p>
They began to meet with buffalo about the mouth
of the James River, in South Dakota, on May 20; the
ground, said Audubon, was literally covered with their
tracks, and the bushes with their hair. On the same day
they discovered "Meadow Larks whose songs and single
notes <i>were</i> quite different from those of the Eastern
States," and this proved to be the first notice of the
Western Meadow Lark, which later appeared as the
<i>Sturnella neglecta</i> in the small edition of his <i>Birds of
America</i>, then in course of publication.
</p>

<p>
Audubon's opinion of the Indian was modified considerably
after having seen him in the western wilderness,
and his confidence in George Catlin's descriptions
was completely shattered; "His book," he said, "must,
after all, be altogether a humbug. Poor devil! I pity
him from the bottom of my soul; had he studied, and
kept up to the old French proverb that says, 'Bon
Renommé vaut mieux que ceinture doré,' he might have
become an honest man—the quintessence of God's
works."
</p>

<p>
After forty-eight days and seven hours out of St.
Louis, on the 12th of June, they reached Fort Union,
at the mouth of the Yellowstone, where the <i>Omega</i> left
them and returned down river. The country proved so
interesting that the naturalist remained two months at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
the fort, where he occupied the room which had been
used by Maximilian, Prince of Neuwied, when traveling
through the western parts of America ten years before;
here Audubon made many drawings. Buffalo were
abundant on all sides, and a favorite occupation was
shooting wolves from the ramparts of the fort. On
June 18 they killed two antelope and two deer before
noon, and "immediately after dinner," he said, "the
head of the old male was cut off, and I went to work
outlining it; first small, with the camera lucida, and
then by squares." On the 30th he wrote: "I began
drawing at five this morning, and worked almost without
cessation till after three, when becoming fatigued
for want of practice, I took a short walk, regretting that
I could no longer draw twelve or fourteen hours without
a pause, or thought of weariness."
</p>

<p>
On the 15th of July they started up the shore of the
Yellowstone in a cart. The party soon had had enough
of buffalo hunting, and on one day the naturalist was
nearly speared by a charging bull that had been wounded.
"What a terrible destruction of life," he says, "as
it were for nothing, or next to it, as the tongues only
were brought in, and the flesh of these fine animals was
left to beasts and birds of prey, or to rot on the spots
where they fell. The prairies are literally <i>covered</i> with
the skulls of the victims, and the roads the Buffalo
make in crossing the prairies have all the appearance of
heavy wagon tracks." Foreseeing the departure of the
buffalo, he wrote:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
One can hardly conceive how it happens, notwithstanding
these many deaths and the immense numbers that are murdered
almost daily on these boundless wastes called prairies,
besides the hosts that are drowned in the freshets, and the hundreds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
of young calves who die in early spring, so many are yet
to be found. Daily we see so many that we hardly notice them
more than the cattle in our pastures about our homes. But
this cannot last; even now there is a perceptible difference in
the size of the herds, and before many years the Buffalo, like
the Great Auk, will have disappeared.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the 9th of August he added: "I have scarcely
done anything but write this day, and my memorandum
books are now crowded with sketches, measurements,
and descriptions." Those who maintain that a "howling
wilderness" is a place that never howls, should read his
note for August 19: "Wolves howling, and bulls roaring,
just like the long continued roll of a hundred
drums"; or this for the 21st: "Buffaloes all over the
bars and prairies, and many swimming; the roaring can
be heard for miles."
</p>

<p>
At Fort Union they built a Mackinaw barge forty
feet long, which they christened the "Union," and on
the 16th of August they started for St. Louis, which
was reached in safety on the 19th of October. There
they unloaded, and "sent all things to Nicholas Berthoud's
warehouse." "Reached home," said Audubon,
"at 3 p. m., November 6th, 1843, and thank God, found
all my family quite well."
</p>

<p>
When Audubon was returning by the canal route
from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, he was sought out by
a young traveler, who afterwards related the following
incident.<a name='FA_194' id='FA_194' href='#FN_194' class='fnanchor'>[194]</a> The naturalist, he was told, was under "a
huge pile of green blankets and fur," which he had already
noticed on one of the benches, and had taken for
the fat pile of some western trader. Having waived
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
his choice of a berth in Audubon's favor, he observed
that "the green bale stirred a little,—half turned upon
its narrow resting place, and after a while sat erect, and
showed us, to our no small surprise, that a man was
inside of it. A patriarchal beard fell white and wavy
down his breast; a pair of hawk-like eyes glanced sharply
out of a fuzzy shroud of cap and collar." When this
stranger, drawn by a sense of irrepressible curiosity, had
ventured near enough to recognize the "noble Roman
countenance" thus obscured, he saw that it was Audubon
in his wilderness dress; he was "hale and erect, with
sixty winters upon his shoulders, and like one of his old
eagles, feathered to the heel." Audubon's conversation,
said this writer, was impulsive and fragmentary,
but he showed him with pleasure some of his original
drawings of animals, as well as a living collection of
foxes, badgers and Rocky Mountain deer, which he was
bringing home.
</p>

<p>
To follow this narrator further:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The confinement we were subjected to on board the canal-boat
was very tiresome to his habits of freedom. We used to
get ashore and walk for hours along the tow-path ahead of the
boat; and I observed with astonishment that, though over
sixty, he could walk us down with ease.... His physical
energies seemed to be entirely unimpaired.... Another striking
evidence of this he gave us. A number of us were standing
grouped around him on the top of the boat, one clear sunshiny
morning; we were at the time passing through a broken
and very picturesque region; his keen eyes, with an abstracted,
intense expression, peculiar to them, were glancing over the
scenery we were gliding through, when suddenly he pointed with
his finger towards the fence of a field, about two hundred yards
off. "See! Yonder is a Fox Squirrel, running along the top
rail. It is not often I have seen them in Pennsylvania." Now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
his power of vision must have been singularly acute, to have distinguished
that it was a Fox Squirrel; for only one other person ... detected
the creature at all.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The second Mrs. Victor G. Audubon<a name='FA_195' id='FA_195' href='#FN_195' class='fnanchor'>[195]</a> said that on
the day the naturalist returned, "the whole family, with
his old friend, Captain Cummings, were on the piazza
waiting for the carriage to come from Harlem.... He
had on a green blanket coat with fur collar and cuffs;
his hair and beard were very long, and he made a fine
striking appearance. In this dress his son John painted
his portrait."<a name='FA_196' id='FA_196' href='#FN_196' class='fnanchor'>[196]</a> This interesting portrait, which is still
in possession of the family, and which is reproduced by
his granddaughter in the work from which we have just
quoted, shows a man whose apparent age, as suggested
by his flowing white hair and grayish white beard, overshoots
the clearer testimony of his smooth face and
bright eye; as already noticed, Audubon had not then
attained his sixtieth year.
</p>

<p>
Upon his return at this time Audubon is said to
have been mistaken for a Dunker, or member of a sect
of Quakers noted for their ample beards. On November
29 Bachman wrote: "I am glad to hear that your
great beard is now cut off. I pictured you to myself, as
I saw you in my home, when you came from Florida, <i>via</i>
Savannah. You jumped down from the top of the
stage. Your beard, two months old, was as gray as a
Badger's. I think a grizzly-bear, forty-seven years old,
would have claimed you as 'par nobile fratrum.'" Bachman
was apparently disturbed about Audubon's personal
habits at this time, for he added in the letter just
quoted: "I am a teatotaler. I drink <i>no wine</i>, and do not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
use <i>snuff</i>. I hope that you are able to say the
same."<a name='FA_197' id='FA_197' href='#FN_197' class='fnanchor'>[197]</a>
</p>

<p>
Spencer Baird wrote to Audubon from Washington,
November 24, 1843, to congratulate him upon the
safe return of his western party, saying: "From time
to time short notices of your whereabouts and doings
appeared in the newspaper and a thousand times I
wished that the fears of my friends had not prevented
me from accompanying you to the scenes of action."
Audubon thought that he might well regret the difficulties
that had stood in his way; in replying he said
that he had seen "not one Rattlesnake and heard not a
Word of bilious fever, or [experienced] anything more
troublesome than Moschitoes and of these by no means
many"; they had brought home a Swift Fox, an American
Badger, and a live Deer, which they thought might
prove to be new, fifteen new birds, as well as a certain
number of quadrupeds, besides "many of the Birds procured
on the Western side of the Big Rocky Hills by
Nuttall and Townsend." He felt that much still remained
to be done, his only regret being that he was
not what he "was 25 Years ago, Strong and Active,
for willing he was as much as ever."
</p>

<p>
In 1844 Audubon brought to a close his octavo edition
of the <i>Birds</i> by adding seventeen species, eleven of
which were new and represented his discoveries on the
Upper Missouri of the previous year. The 500th plate,
and last of the series which marked the end of Audubon's
life-long labors in ornithology, was dedicated to
"Baird's Bunting," <i>Emberiza bairdii</i>. "If a trace of
sentiment be permissible in bibliography," said Elliott
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
Coues,<a name='FA_198' id='FA_198' href='#FN_198' class='fnanchor'>[198]</a> "I should say that the completion of that splendid
series of plates with the name <i>bairdii</i> was significant;
the glorious Audubonian sun had set indeed, but in the
dedicating of the species to his young friend Spencer
F. Baird the scepter was handed to one who was to wield
it with a force that no other ornithologist of America
has ever exercised."

<p>
After 1844 Audubon's remaining energies were devoted
exclusively to his work on the <i>Quadrupeds</i>, in
which it is necessary to discriminate between the large
folio of illustrations, which began to appear, in parts,
as early as 1842 and which was completed in 1846; the
text, of which he lived to see but one volume finished;
and lastly, the first and only composite edition of both
text and plates, which was published by Victor Audubon
in 1854.<a name='FA_199' id='FA_199' href='#FN_199' class='fnanchor'>[199]</a> This series of works, as already noticed, was
produced in collaboration with the Reverend John
Bachman, of Charleston, South Carolina; Bachman assumed
entire responsibility for the text, but owing to
his comparative isolation from large libraries, and to
the demands of professional duties, he depended on the
Audubons to supply him with specimens and books.
</p>

<p>
Honest John Bachman, whose motto was, "Nature,
Truth, and no Humbug," was suffering sadly, he said,
from lack of tools, when he wrote to Victor Audubon in
November, 1844:<a name='FA_200' id='FA_200' href='#FN_200' class='fnanchor'>[200]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The books are to be found in New York and Philadelphia,
but are expensive. I would not have you buy them; but could
you not copy for me such articles as we need?
</p>

<p>
I enclose my plan. I wish always, a month before the time,
that you would give me notice of the species you intend to put
into the hands of the engraver, and send me, at the same
time, the specimen. I cannot describe without it; I will guess at
nothing.
</p>

<p>
I find the labor greater than I expected, and fear that I
may break down and, therefore, cry in time, "Help me Cassius
or I sink!" Writing descriptions is slow and fatiguing
work. I cannot, in the careful manner that I am doing them
write more than three in a week. My son-in-law, Haskell, has
copied forty-two closely written pages for me. I cannot
shorten the articles, many of them I ought rather to lengthen.
With patience and the help of all, I hope, however, to get on—the
work may be lighter as we proceed.
</p>

<p>
The following is my daily practice: I am up at 4 A. M.,
and work till breakfast, and recently, when parochial duties
would permit, have kept on until 3 P. M.
</p>

<p>
The brush of my old friend, Audubon, is a truth-teller. I
regard his drawings as the best in the world. Let us be very
careful to correct any errors of description that have crept in
on the plates—I see a few in the lettering—they can be corrected
in the letter-press; and let us be so cautious as to have
nothing in the future to correct. There is but one principle
on which a just man can act; that is, always to seek the truth
and to abide by it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Bachman wrote again on the 29th of that month:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
About the little mouse—I cannot see a needle in a haystack;
or give it a name without knowing what it is. Friend, descriptions
cannot be written, as a man works at making Jews-harps—so
many a dozen in a given time. My credit, as well as your
father's, is so deeply concerned, that <i>I will not publish a day
before I am ready</i>....

do all that I wish. In doing this, however, you will have your
hands full. Mine are so—God knows! Will not my old friend,
Audubon, wake up, and work as he used to do, when we banged
at the Herons and the fresh water Marsh-hens?
</p>
</div>

<p>
Bachman explained that he was the "schoolmaster," and
when the boys were a little lazy, he would have to apply
the whip.
</p>

<p>
In March, 1844, Spencer Baird sent Audubon a live
Pennant's Marten or Fisher, a rather rare animal even
at that time, and now all but extinct. Said Baird:<a name='FA_201' id='FA_201' href='#FN_201' class='fnanchor'>[201]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It was found in company with an older one, in Peter's
mountain, six miles above Harrisburg about five weeks ago.
After a most desperate resistance the old one was killed, having
beaten off a large pack of dogs, to whose assistance the
hunters were obliged to run. This individual ran up a tree,
and being stoned by the men, jumped off to a distance of forty
feet! when being a little stunned by the leap they ran up
quickly and threw their coats over it, and then secured it. The
old one measured three feet and a half from nose to end of
tail, and was about one third larger than this.... It seems
to be in very good health, and is without exception the most
unmitigatedly savage beast I ever saw. The Royal Bengal
Tiger, or the Laughing Hyena are neither of them circumstances
to it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon used this marten as the model for his illustration
of the species (shown in natural size, Plate xli of
the <i>Quadrupeds</i>); in noticing its habits later, he said:<a name='FA_202' id='FA_202' href='#FN_202' class='fnanchor'>[202]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We kept this individual alive for some days, feeding it on
raw meat, pieces of chicken, and now and then a bird. It was
voracious, and very spiteful, growling, snarling and spitting
when approached, but did not appear to suffer much uneasiness
from being held in captivity, as, like many other predacious
quadrupeds it grew fat, being better supplied with food
than when it had been obliged to cater for itself in the woods.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Baird also tried to secure for Audubon the "far-famed
catamount" alive, which, from stories related by
hunters, he thought might be different from the young
of the panther or puma, and also a specimen of the true
black fox in the flesh; though unsuccessful in either
quest, his efficient aid was greatly appreciated by his
friend. In February, 1845, Baird paid a visit to the
Audubons at their Hudson River home, where he was
warmly received; as his biographer relates,<a name='FA_203' id='FA_203' href='#FN_203' class='fnanchor'>[203]</a> upon leaving
he was invited to select any duplicate bird skins he
desired from the naturalist's collection, then at John G.
Bell's taxidermist shop in New York; he accepted this
generous offer, and chose about forty specimens.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that some trouble-maker had disturbed
the serenity of John Bachman's mind when the following
interesting letter was written by Audubon to balm
the feelings of his old friend. It is evident that Audubon
at this time expected to collaborate in the letterpress of
their work, but that plan, according to Bachman's own
statement, was never carried out:

<span class="smcap">My dear friend</span>
</p>

<p>
Never have I been so much astonished as I have been at reading
your letter to Victor, and to which I feel myself bound to
answer at once.
</p>

<p>

<p>
In the first place you must have been most unmercifully misled
by the "mutual friend" of whom you speak, when saying
that through that individual <i>you did</i> understand that I never
used your name as a coadjutor in the work, which is now publishing
on the Quadrupeds of North America under the names
of both I and you—Why you should have taken such a report
or saying as truth is actually beyond my most remote thought,
and again, why did you not long ago, write to me at once on
this mysterious subject.
</p>

<p>
But to put an end to all this stuff, let me assure you that
nothing of the kind has ever taken place, and this I could well
prove by upwards of one hundred of our last subscribers, all of
whom would be ready to testify that before receiving their
names on my list, I always mentioned your name to each of
them, and many that know you were glad that I had so good
and so learned a man at my elbow—I should amazingly be glad
to know who the "mutual friend" is, as I think I could give
him a lesson on propriety, being a mutual friend, that would
serve that kind gentleman for the residue of his life—But
enough of this, and all that I am sorry for is that you should
not have answered "my short letters," in some of which I particularly
requested you to forward me a fine black bear and
one or two wolves, by which you would have saved me fully fifty
dollars as I have had to pay sixty dollars for two of these vile
rascals, and two hundred dollars for a pair of Elks besides
paying the highest of prices to draw other animals—
</p>

<p>
Now my friend I wish you would set in real earnest, and
whenever it is convenient to you in preparing the letter-press
for our work. I have made a beginning and have written Ten
articles already in — days, to wit all the plates of N<span class="sup">o</span> 1, and
the first of N<span class="sup">o</span> 2 which are as follows—
</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Lynx Rufus—Wild-Cat</li>
<li>Arctomys monax—Maryland Marmot</li>
<li>Lepus Townsendii</li>
<li>Neotoma Floridana</li>
<li>Sciurus Richardsonii</li>
<li>Canis (Vulpes) fulvus<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span></li>
<li>The Beaver</li>
<li>The history of the Bison 28 pages</li>
<li>and Fiber Zybethicus (muskrat) 12 pages,</li>
<li>Tamias quadrivittatus</li>
</ul>

<p>
This will shew you that I have not been very Idle since I
began and I should like to know from you, whether you would
like to see what I have said of these, as if you do, I will have
them copied as soon as I receive your letter, and will forward
the whole, and the additional written in the interim, at the same
time. I have a beautiful drawing of a fine male moose, that
of the Elk is already engraved, and next week we will forward
to the engraver no less than five or six drawings of the best
quality. by the way I am sorry that you should look upon
the Texan Skunk as a bad figure. The animal is an ungraceful
one in its Singular Colouring, but it is nevertheless quite true
to nature, with all its specific characters to a <i>T</i>.
</p>

<p>
Victor wrote to you that I was anxious to have your opinion
about the Title page and I hope you will send me your
ideas forthwith on that subject. I send you now by mail a long
article about our work which I conceive and hope will prove
to you that the "mutual friend" knew but very little of my
feelings or actions or sayings as regards you—
</p>

<p>
I really &amp; most truly regret that you should have been put
out, and mis-led about this our work by a third party, who
must to say the least of it [have] abused your credulity to the
very extreme.
</p>

<p>
However, the sooner forgotten, the sooner mended. it is
with deeply felt regret from every one of my Family that we
read the account in your letter of the condition of your dear
wife, but hope that she will accompany you early next spring
to visit our humble but comfortable residence. Now do Come!
Present our joint regards to every one of your family, and
believe me when I say that none will ever feel more delighted
than I, to hear of the welfare of the beautiful "Rabbit"—
</p>

<p>
And now that I am exceedingly fatigued, having been writing
for upwards of seven hours, I will wish you good night &amp;
all the blessings that God may grant to [the] good man and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
to every member of his family—Do not forget me near your

<p>
In July, 1845, a destructive fire devastated a large
section of the city of New York, including the warehouse
in which the copperplates of Audubon's <i>Birds</i>
were stored; many believed that the plates had been
ruined, and one of these was the writer who after witnessing
the event gave the following dramatic account:<a name='FA_204' id='FA_204' href='#FN_204' class='fnanchor'>[204]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
But who had lost most of all that pale crowd that hung like
ghosts around the scene, and gazed with watery eyes, and blue
compressed lips, over the ruin? An erect old man, with long
white hair, glanced his strong bright eye as coldly over the
glowing, smoking desolation, as an eagle would, who watched
the sunrise chasing mists up from the valley. J. J. Audubon
looks over the grave of the labor of forty years!
</p>

<p>
<i>The Plates of the Birds of America</i> are buried beneath
those smoldering piles! Ye money changers dare not break the
stillness with a sob, though the last cent of your sordid hoards
be gone! ... go away! Ye have lost nothing!... Yet
that dauntless old man is not dismayed; he and Fate knew each
other's faces in battle long ago. Let those who know how to
love and venerate such labors—to sympathize with such grievous
calamities, exhibit it in their prompt patronage of the new
work now issuing—The Quadrupeds of America—and in the
care which shall be taken to preserve the volumes of the Plates
of the Birds, now in existence—the value of which will be five-fold
increased!
</p>
</div>

<p>
When Baird heard the untoward news, he wrote
from Carlisle, August 4, 1845: "It is with sincerest regret
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
that I see by the papers that your copper plates
were injured or perhaps ruined by the fire which occurred
a few weeks ago. Various reports are circulated
respecting your loss, and among so many contradictory
ones it is difficult to get at the truth of the case. Might
I ask you to let me know the truth of the matter." In
a postscript to this letter he added: "I forgot to say
that I have been elected professor of Natural History in
Dickinson College. The situation is entirely nominal,
nothing to do &amp; no salary whatever." Audubon replied
promptly on the 7th of August:<a name='FA_205' id='FA_205' href='#FN_205' class='fnanchor'>[205]</a> "You have been too
well-informed about the plates of our large work. They
have indeed passed through the great fire of the 19 ul°;
but we are now engaged in trying to restore them to
their wonted former existence; although a few of them
will have to be reingraved for use, if ever that work is
republished in its original size at all."
</p>

<p>
Bachman, who paid a long visit to the Audubons
in the late summer or early autumn of 1845, said that
while he was at "Minnie's Land," Audubon painted
"Le Conte's Pine Mouse" with his usual facility and
skill, but he detected a change in his mental powers.
For a long time Bachman had complained of the want
of books, which the younger Audubons failed to supply,
and of lack of specimens, which no doubt their father
wished to retain for use in his own studies, until at
length his patience was gone and he tried another form
of appeal. The following letter<a name='FA_206' id='FA_206' href='#FN_206' class='fnanchor'>[206]</a> to their mutual friend,
Edward Harris, shows that he was then determined to
throw up the responsibility which had been assumed in
the <i>Quadrupeds</i> unless what he regarded as "reasonable
requests" were complied with forthwith:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
</p>

<h4>
<i>John Bachman to Edward Harris</i>
</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letter_head">
<span class="smcap">Charleston</span>, <i>Decem. 24</i>, 1845.
</p>

<p>
Friend Harris, you can be of service to me, to the Audubons
&amp; the cause of science. I will tell you how.
</p>

<p>
I find the Audubons are not aware of what is wanted in
the publication of the Quadrupeds. All they care about is to
get out a No. of engravings in two months. They have not
sent me one single book out of a list of 100 I gave them and
only 6 lines copied from a book after having written for them
for 4 years. When he published his birds he collected hundreds
of thousands of specimens. In his Quadrupeds—tell it not in
Gath—He never collected or sent me one skin from New York
to Louisiana along the whole of the Atlantic States. Now he
is clamorous for the letter press—on many of the Quadrupeds
he has not sent me one line &amp; and on others he has omitted
even the geographical range—I know nothing of what he did
in the West having never received his journal &amp; not twenty
lines on the subject. I am to write a book without the information
he promised to give—without books of reference &amp;
above all what is a sine qua non to me without specimens. In
the meantime my name is attached to the book, and the public
look to us to settle our American species, and alas I have not
the materials to do so.
</p>

<p>
Now this you can do for me. I am willing to write every
description and every line of the book. I do it without fee or
reward. But—1. Books of reference or copies of them he must
obtain. 2. He must publish no species without my approbation.
He has made some sad mistakes already. 3. He must
procure such information as I shall write for. 4. <i>He must
send some person—say when John returns—to make a tour for
collecting specimens through the states of the west especially.</i>
I find the smaller Rodentia differing every 600 miles. Richardson's
species differ from those of New York—ours are once
more different from those of N. Y. Leib [?] found a number
of new species in Illinois. The New Orleans squirrels differ
from ours—California once more new. Now on this last particular—the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
necessity of giving me specimens to describe from
I wish you to speak to Audubon. I cannot consent to impose
on the public. I cannot settle the species without specimens.
[Tell] him what I have written and [of what I have] complained.
Show him this letter if you should [think] it will accomplish
the end. I shall soon have the volume finished as
well as I am able from the scanty materials with which I am
furnished. Then they will be clamorous for the second volume.
Now I do not like to make any threats, but if my reasonable
requests are not complied with I have made up my mind
not to write another line at the end of the first volume. I
have not made up my mind hastily. It is the result of four
years remonstrance, mortification, and disappointment. Once
and for nearly a year I gave up the matter in hopeless despair.
I again resumed it on the solemn promise of Victor to do all I
wished. Three months have since gone round and not one
book sent—only ten lines copied—and a constant clamor for
the letter press. But I am called off.
</p>
</div>

<p>
If Audubon was remiss in supplying the necessary
materials, it is possible that Bachman, in turn, may have
failed to appreciate the load which his friend's shoulders
had carried for the five years then past. To Bachman
specimens and books were, of course, absolutely essential,
but Audubon needed them also, as well as subscribers
and the large sums of money necessary to keep
his great enterprises in orderly movement. At all
events, Bachman's ultimatum brought immediate results,
and it might not be wide of the mark to affirm that
to the tactful Harris we virtually owe the completion of
that admirable work, <i>The Viviparous Quadrupeds of
North America</i>. It should be noticed that at the time
the complaining letter was sent, John W. Audubon was
in Texas, engaged in making collections, though, as it
proved, with little success; Victor searched the country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
for the needed books, and his father's Missouri River
journal was despatched to Charleston, without delay.
</p>

<p>
On New Year's Day, 1846, Bachman wrote to his
friend:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
As I do not like to disappoint you in anything, I send you
one of the articles. It is about a fair sample of the whole....
I try to incorporate as much as I can of your own, but, in most
cases, your notes have come too late.
</p>

<p>
You see how plain Haskell writes: I should think that by
this time, he has copied three hundred pages as correctly as the
inclosed.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In his letter of March 6 he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
For the last four nights, I have been reading your journal.
I am much interested, though I find less about the quadrupeds
than I expected. The narratives are particularly spirited,
and often instructive, as well as amusing. All that you write
on the spot, I can depend on, but I never trust to the memory
of others, any more than to my own....
</p>

<p>
To return to your Journal. I am afraid that the shadows
of the Elk, Buffalo, and Bighorn hid the little Marmots, Squirrels
and Jumping Mice. I wish you had engaged some of the
hunters to set traps. I should like to get the Rabbit that led
you so weary a chase. Write to C.<a name='FA_207' id='FA_207' href='#FN_207' class='fnanchor'>[207]</a> and find out some way of
getting—not his princess brain-eating, horse-straddling squaw,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
but what is better than such a specimen from the Blackfoot
country—1st. The Skunk; 2nd, Hares, in Winter colors; and
3rd, the Rabbit that you chased. In your Journal your descriptions
of Buffalo hunts are first rate. I don't like my
article on the "Beaver"; I shall have to write it over again.
If I could only borrow <i>Temminck's</i> large work. Every library
here is open to me, and you would be astonished to see the number
of books in my own library; but the scientific works of close
comparison are not among them. I had written letter after
letter, but might have saved ten dollars postage.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon wrote to Baird on February 2, 1846, to
remind him of the Catamount, which was thought not
to be "the Cougar," and of the Black Fox: "for the
latter," he said, "I do give you my word that I would
willingly pay you Twenty Dollars by a draft upon us
at Sight." In another letter from "Minnie's Land, N.
Y.," of March 14, he said:<a name='FA_208' id='FA_208' href='#FN_208' class='fnanchor'>[208]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Could you procure a black and a Silver Fox for us, we will
be willing to give a good price for either in the flesh, and preserved
in common New England Rum, and forwarded by express
to 78 John St, N.Y.
</p>

<p>
We expect to see John at home in about Six or Seven
weeks. He has made a very poor Journey of this one, and will
have to go to Europe this summer, I have no doubt.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Concerning his son's journey to Texas, Audubon
had written Spencer Baird, September 30, 1845:<a name='FA_209' id='FA_209' href='#FN_209' class='fnanchor'>[209]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My son John will leave this for the West and South-West,
as far as the confines of Texas, about the last of next month,
and intends being absent until the first of March. Would you
like to go with him provided you can pay your own expenses?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
He will take one of our Servant men along to help him in the
procuring of Quadrupeds and Birds, of which he hopes to procure
some, if not a good number of new Species.
</p>
</div>

<p>
As Baird gave no reply, Audubon sat down on Christmas
Day, 1845, and wrote again to his young friend:<a name='FA_210' id='FA_210' href='#FN_210' class='fnanchor'>[210]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I hope and trust that you were not offended at my letter,
when I wrote you on the Subject of accompanying our son
John to Texas where he is now I hope safe and sound, and I
believe at Corpus Christi....
</p>

<p>
... I have at last received a fine Red Fox from our Friend
Ed. Harris, who although he did not kill it, obtained the
Cunning Animal very shortly after its death. I have drawn it
to the size of life, and I think made a good figure of it.
</p>

<p>
I have been drawing pretty constantly these last past
weeks and have finished 6 plates for the Engravers.... We
are all hard at Work preparing the letterpress for the 1st
Vol. of the Quadrupeds, a copy of which I hope to send to you
about the beginning of April.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon's prediction in regard to his son was correct,
and after John's return from Texas, in April,
1846, he started for England on June 10, with his wife
and family; he remained in Europe until May, 1847,
engaged, as his father said, "in making figures of those
arctic animals, of which accessible specimens exist only
in the museums of that quarter of the globe."
</p>

<p>
The Audubons, as we have seen, now tried to keep
John Bachman better supplied, and in the spring of
1846 sent him several boxes of skins, with the urgent
request that all which pertained to animals that had not
been figured be returned as soon as possible. On March
13 Victor wrote that Temminck's monograph could not
be found in all America, not in Boston, or Philadelphia,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
but that a copy would be ordered from Europe at once.
In those days Charleston was farther removed in time
from New York than California is now from Boston;
two weeks was required for a letter of one naturalist
to reach the other, and the difficulties of coöperation
were correspondingly great. On May 31 Audubon acknowledged
the return of the skins, but said: "Judge of
my astonishment, when I could not find a single one of
the small animals, Shrews, and Scalops argentatus, the
latter of which I am anxious to draw at once."
</p>

<p>
The summer and autumn of 1846 bore heavily on
John Bachman, subject as he then was to a "thousand
calls and interruptions," and "bowed down, and almost
distracted, with anxieties and grief."<a name='FA_211' id='FA_211' href='#FN_211' class='fnanchor'>[211]</a> But the first
volume of the letterpress which had given him so much
trouble was finished in November, and was published by
Audubon at the close of this year. It was at once recognized
as a standard and authoritative work, which was
then without a competitor in America, and as Louis
Agassiz affirmed, without an equal in Europe. At the
time of its issue the twentieth number of the folio illustrations
was nearly ready; the text itself had 271 subscribers,
calling for 281 copies,<a name='FA_212' id='FA_212' href='#FN_212' class='fnanchor'>[212]</a> though only the eastern
cities had then been canvassed.

Early in 1846 Baird wrote to Audubon:<a name='FA_213' id='FA_213' href='#FN_213' class='fnanchor'>[213]</a> "I have
made drawings of the sculls of our quadrupeds which
are at your service if you want them. They are Mink,

Wild Cat, Ground Hog, <i>Lepus Sylvaticus</i>, <i>Neotoma
Floridana</i> and others. I have got a Camera Lucida now
and intend trying to draw with it. Anything I can do
for you in this way will be cheerfully done." When he
wrote again, towards the close of this year, some important
events had happened, as shown by this letter:

<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Audubon</span>
</p>

<p>
I have been intending to write for a long time, to find out
how you all are at Minnie's Landing, and how yourself is particularly,
but have put it off from time to time for various reasons.
I can do so no longer, and must beg you to let me know
these particulars.
</p>

<p>
Since my last visit to you, two pretty important events
have happened to me. The first was getting married, the second,
settling down steadily in my Professional chair.<a name='FA_214' id='FA_214' href='#FN_214' class='fnanchor'>[214]</a> My
wife is the only daughter of Col. Churchill Inspector Gen. of
the Army, now with Gen. Wool in Mexico. She suits me exactly,
being as fond of birds &amp; snakes &amp; fishes etc. as myself.
I have even given her a lesson or two in taxidermy.
</p>

<p>
My duties as professor consist in teaching Animal Physiology,
Natural Theology &amp; Mathematics. My salary is small
$400 but I hope will be larger hereafter. I have to work hard,
but that is good for me.
</p>

<p>
Please let me know how the quadrupeds get along. Is the
first vol. published? How does John get along in England?
What has become of his Texas birds?
</p>

<p>
Please to tell me the address of your friend Ayres. I
have been collecting fishes for some weeks, and wish to correspond
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
&amp; exchange with him on this subject. I can send him a
good many species.
</p>

<p>
Please give my love to all your kind family. My wife (to
whom two years ago I gave a picture of yourself, as the most
acceptable present) sends hers also, and desires exceedingly to
see one to whom her husband owes so many obligations of every
kind. Believe to be as ever

<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,
</p>

<p>
We were very happy to hear of your Success in obtaining
a Professorship. I wish you had been more minute as to the
amount of your Salary as I consider 400$ as a very small
sum. If you have not a house, fuel, and furniture, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c to
compensate for so small a sum, and having so much to perform
for it. We are all glad that you have a good helpmate
in the shape of a wife, and we would be very glad to have
you under our roof, even now; but as the winter is now fast approaching
we hope to see you certainly some time next spring,
or during the summer, as you know that then our place is
worthy to reside at. The fishing is then Capital. The residence
of our Friend, W. O. Ayers, is on Long Island, and I
think that a letter addressed to him at Sag-Harbor, will be
sure to be received by that good Friend of ours.
</p>

<p>
He will be glad to receive the collection of fishes which you
have procured for him, and I know will be most happy to exchange
for other fishes or subjects if you should desire any
at his hands. Please to give your Dear Lady our best love,
and congratulations on her having such a capitally perfect
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
husband. We are all well at present. I have not done anything
with the Birds which, indeed, my son Victor has sent to the
Academy of Philadelphia. I suppose I need not look any more
for a Black Fox in the flesh from you during the next winter.
</p>

<p>
Consider me always my Dear Friend,

<p>
Victor Audubon's gift of the volume was acknowledged
by Baird on January 19, 1847, when he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have been trying for some time past to find time for
writing and thanking you for the copy of the Viviparous text.
Never had mortal man such a feast as I in turning over the
pages and reading the interesting and copious accounts of the
habits of animals, many of which were unknown to me beyond
the name. I was exceedingly gratified by the kind terms I
found myself mentioned throughout the book, more so than
I deserve. Be assured that no effort of mine however humble
shall be spared to assist in the perfecting a labor so stupendous
and important as that in which you are engaged. Would that
I could be of more substantial aid by sending half a dozen subscribers,
I may do so yet, who knows.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was soon another matter of vital importance
which Baird wished to announce to his friend, and, on
February 8, he wrote Audubon:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Very much to my astonishment I received last Saturday a
letter from Mr. Dana saying that he had written to Dr. Pickering
that I would make a good curator of the Smithsonian institute,
and advising me if I wished the place to write immediately
to Prof. Henry and enclose my credentials. Now
I would like the situation amazingly and write to ask you to
make out a flaming recommendation for the place &amp; send me
as soon as possible. Say what you please about qualification
&amp;c. I would be obliged to you for the exertion of any
personal influence you may have on the board of Regents.
When there I would hope to be materially useful to you in
your labors.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This was followed, on February 11, by a cordial letter
from Audubon, in which he said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I am quite convinced myself that no one can easily be found
so well adapted for such a trust as yourself and if my testimoney
as to your knowledge and high character and industry,
and your zeal in seeking a perfect acquaintance with the various
branches of Natural History, and all the scientific and
literary pursuits which have heretofore occupied you, may be
of any service, please present this note to the Honorable Board
of Regents, who I trust will receive it as an evidence of my
ardent desire for your success, the more readily as I have the
honor, I think, of knowing some of the Board personally.

"QUADRUPEDS" (ENGLISH EDITION) PRESENTED TO JOHN E. GRAY.
</p>
</div> <!-- /figcenter -->

<p>
John W. Audubon spent the winter of 1846-47 in
London, where he was engaged in painting subjects for
his father's work on the <i>Quadrupeds</i>. While he was
there, arrangements were made for the publication in
that city of the first volume of the letterpress; this appeared
in May, 1847,<a name='FA_217' id='FA_217' href='#FN_217' class='fnanchor'>[217]</a> closely following the American
edition of the previous year, and it was the only European
issue of the text of that work. At this time also
John Audubon made the acquaintance of the distinguished
zoölogist, John Edward Gray, then in charge
of the great collections which were being brought together
under his direction at the British Museum. Gray
was asked to furnish descriptions of the animals which
the younger Audubon had painted, but, as will appear
from the following letter, he declined:<a name='FA_218' id='FA_218' href='#FN_218' class='fnanchor'>[218]</a>

<p>
I am very sorry that I am so occupied that I cannot undertake
to furnish you with the descriptions of the American
Mammalia which you have figured here but I think you will find
that Dr Richardsons descriptions are so accurate and detailed
that you had better copy them for the work than have more
imperfect descriptions by a less experienced and minute describer.
</p>

<p>
at the same time should Dr Bachman on composing the
Work want any note or the distinction between any two species
or the description of any one wh have not contained in Richardson
Work &amp; he will write to me I shall have great pleasure
in immediately replying to his request—

Bachman was married in 1849 to Maria Martin,<a name='FA_219' id='FA_219' href='#FN_219' class='fnanchor'>[219]</a> his
former wife's sister, who had aided Audubon in drawing
the accessories of his large plates. While engaged upon
the <i>Quadrupeds</i>, he wrote to Victor Audubon, from
Madison Springs, Georgia, on June 30 of that year, as
follows:<a name='FA_220' id='FA_220' href='#FN_220' class='fnanchor'>[220]</a>

This is my tenth working-day. I have finished seventeen

of your notes as I could. Maria copies carefully. She lops
off to the right and the left with your notes and mine: she
corrects, criticizes, abuses, and praises us by turns. Your
father's notes, copied from his journal, are valuable—they contain
real information; some of the others are humbug and
rigmarole; but you have done so well as to surprise us....

CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.

<p>
About thirty years later, when Victor Audubon's
sister-in-law<a name='FA_221' id='FA_221' href='#FN_221' class='fnanchor'>[221]</a> was making a disposition of his literary
effects, a bundle of manuscripts was saved and given
to Mr. George Bird Grinnell. Included in it were a
number of Audubon's letters, which are now reproduced,
as well as a considerable section of the printer's copy of
<i>The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America</i>, Volume
I; this was in various handwritings, including little of
Bachman's himself, much of Victor's and of John G.
Bell's; a little of this copy also was made by the second
Mrs. Bachman and by other and unknown hands, possibly
those of one of Bachman's daughters and of his
son-in-law, Reverend John Haskell, all of whom are
known to have assisted in this labor.
</p>

<p>
When we recall the disadvantages under which John
Bachman worked, it must be acknowledged that he was
deserving of all the credit which he received. Born of
Swiss and German stock at Rheinbeck, New York, in
1790, he clearly remembered walking in the mock
funeral procession that was held in his village when the
country was mourning the death of Washington in 1799.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
From early boyhood he was an ardent enthusiast in the
study of nature, at a time when such studies were generally
frowned upon in country districts as not only
idle but positively harmful. He trapped the beaver,
and from the sale of its skins was able to make his first
purchase of books on natural history. While a young
man he became acquainted with Alexander Wilson and
learned to know him well, having joined him in field
excursions and collected birds for him in northern New
York; on Wilson's recommendation he succeeded both
him and his nephew, William Duncan, in the Elwood
School, at Milestown, Pennsylvania, where he taught
for a year. While there, a youth of barely fifteen, he
was invited, no doubt through the influence of Wilson,
to meet Alexander von Humboldt at a dinner given in
honor of the great traveler at Philadelphia in 1804.
From a pastorate in Shagticoke, New York, Bachman in
1815 went to Charleston, South Carolina, where he presided
over the Lutheran church for nearly sixty years,
and became thoroughly identified with the South. Beloved
as few men ever are in their community, he was
widely honored for his attainments in natural science.
</p>

<p>
In an address on Humboldt, dictated by Bachman
when in his eightieth year, and too feeble to deliver it
himself, he alluded to the event noticed above to show
"how scanty, in those days, was the material in natural
science." Among the few naturalists who were present
on the occasion of the dinner, which was held in Peale's
Museum, were, he said:<a name='FA_222' id='FA_222' href='#FN_222' class='fnanchor'>[222]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
the two Bartrams, Wilson, the ornithologist, Lawson, his engraver,
George Ord and a few others.... Few speeches were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
made and those were short—there was no formality....
Humboldt was then, as he was afterwards, in every society,
"the observed of all observers".... I saw him every day during
the few days he remained in Philadelphia. He inserted my
name in his note-book, and for the last sixty years we corresponded
at long intervals.... It would be very gratifying
to me, and interesting to your societies, if I could have
exhibited to you his autograph in some of his letters; but,
alas! my whole library and all my collections in Natural History,
the accumulation of the labors of a long life, were burnt
by Sherman's vandal army, and, with the exception of a single
letter, which, by accident, fell into the hands of another member
of my family, I possess no memorials of one who condescended
to speak of me as a friend.
</p>
</div>

<p>
As we have noticed, Audubon's large illustrations of
the <i>Quadrupeds</i> were completed in 1846; this marked
the ebb tide of his powers, and his son, John, who had
painted nearly one-half of the originals of the large
plates, like Victor, continued to aid Bachman in the
prosecution of that work. The first number of this
lithographic series was introduced by the common American
wildcat, or <i>Lynx rufus</i>, in three-quarters natural
size, followed by the proverbial ground hog, "Maryland
marmot," or woodchuck, shown in both young and
adult state, in the size of life. Plate No. 4 reproduced
an exquisite drawing of four Florida rats climbing over
a pine branch. Some of the elder Audubon's plates of
squirrels are particularly fine and recall the best of
his more famous bird pictures; the gray fox (No. 3,
Plate xxi) is sniffing at a feather blown from a farmer's
yard; in another drawing a rascally old black rat and
its three young ones are robbing a hen's nest and breaking
up the eggs; Hudson Bay squirrels reach after hazel
nuts which hang in clusters from green boughs above;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
opossums, with sardonic grin, are making for the ripe,
orange fruits of the persimmon, holding to the branch
with their rat-like, coiled tails; the swift fox (<i>Vulpes
velox</i>) sits on the ground, barking like a dog, with head
up-turned, while the better known red fox (No. 18,
Plate lxxxvii) struggles in an old-fashioned steel trap,
the toothed jaws of which have gripped a paw above the
heel, and you observe that his tail is where, in the circumstances,
it is bound to be—between his legs. While
many of these plates are of the highest degree of excellence,
the colors are apt to be too vivid and the execution
is far from uniform.

Thomas M. Brewer, a valued friend and correspondent,<a name='FA_223' id='FA_223' href='#FN_223' class='fnanchor'>[223]</a>
in response to an urgent request, "ere it be too

</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I found him in a retreat well worthy of so true a lover of
nature. It was a lovely spot, on a well-wooded point running
out in the river. His dwelling was a large old-fashioned wooden
house, from the veranda of which was a fine view, looking both
up and down the stream, and around the dwelling were grouped
several fine old forest trees of beech and oak. The grounds
were well stocked with pets of various kinds, both birds and
beasts, while his wild feathered favorites, hardly less confiding,
had their nests over his very doorway. Through the grounds
ran a small rivulet, over which was a picturesque rural bridge.
</p>

<p>
The patriarch ... had greatly changed since I had last
seen him. He wore his hair longer, and it now hung in locks of
snowy whiteness over his shoulders. His once piercing gray
eyes, though still bright, had already begun to fail him. He
could no longer paint with his wonted accuracy, and had at
last, most reluctantly, been forced to surrender to his sons the
task of completing his Quadrupeds of North America. Surrounded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
by his large family, including his devoted wife, his
two sons, and their wives, his enjoyment of life seemed to
leave little to him to desire. He was very fond of the rising
generation, and they were as devoted in their affectionate regards
for him. He seemed to enjoy to the utmost each moment
of time, content at last to submit to an inevitable and well
earned leisure, and to throw upon his gifted sons his uncompleted
tasks. A pleasanter scene or a more interesting household
it has never been the writer's good fortune to witness.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Audubon's last (?) letter to Edward Harris, here reproduced,
is dated at "Minnie's Land, Feby 22, 1847,"
and refers to the letterpress of the <i>Quadrupeds</i>. His
last published letter to Baird, in which he recommended
him to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,<a name='FA_225' id='FA_225' href='#FN_225' class='fnanchor'>[225]</a>
was written at "Minnie's Land, Feb. 11,
1847." In Spencer F. Baird's last published letter<a name='FA_226' id='FA_226' href='#FN_226' class='fnanchor'>[226]</a>
to him, dated at "Carlisle April 24, 1847," he refers to
"a fine specimen living of a Red Fox," and added: "If
you want him let me know <i>immediately</i> and I will send
him on <i>immediately</i>." On July 16 of that year Baird
entered this note in his diary:<a name='FA_227' id='FA_227' href='#FN_227' class='fnanchor'>[227]</a> "Went to Mr. Audubon's
by stage. Found him much changed."
</p>

<p>
While Audubon never became blind, as has been
erroneously stated, it troubled him to use glasses, and
when from failing powers he could no longer paint, his
heart seemed broken. Like Jonathan Swift, who compared
his own case with that of the proud forest tree
whose withering top showed to every passerby the first
sign of decrepitude, so the mind of Audubon gave way
before his splendid physique utterly broke down.

Bachman, who visited his old friend in the spring of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
1848, has given this picture of the naturalist's household
in a letter<a name='FA_228' id='FA_228' href='#FN_228' class='fnanchor'>[228]</a> from "Minnie's Land, May 11, 1848":
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I found all well here, as far as health is concerned. Mrs.
Audubon is straight as an arrow, and in fine health, but sadly
worried. John has just come in from feeding his dogs. Audubon
has heard his little song sung in French, and has gone to
bed. Alas, my poor friend, Audubon, the outlines of his countenance
and his form are there, but his noble mind is all in
ruins.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The following letter was written by Victor Audubon
to his father-in-law, John Bachman, before February
8, 1849, when his brother started on the ill-fated
expedition to which he refers:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My brother will leave in a few days for California, he will
be absent, perhaps for eighteen months.
</p>

<p>
This journey is undertaken with the hope that he may be
able to get gold. What may be the result, God only knows.
John will be accompanied by Col. H. L. Webb, as military
leader; the party consists of about eighty picked men. One
of Dr. Mayer's sons wished to go with John, but unluckily,
his application came after the party was made up, so they could
not take him.
</p>

<p>
I should like much to see you all, but now it will be impossible
for me to go so far from home.
</p>

<p>
My dear old father is apparently comfortable, and enjoys
his little notions; but requires constant care and attendance;
the rest are well. Your granddaughters are growing finely,
and are well educated; soon we shall call in a "<i>Maitre de
danse</i>," to polish them up and <i>improve their understanding</i>.

I am just about to start for Washington, to get letters
from the President for John and I will try and see the collection
brought back by the exploring expedition, including the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
famous Black-tail Deer. I am in a great bustle, the office is
full of Californians.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The California party, which eventually consisted of
nearly one hundred young men, sought to reach the
goldfields by way of Texas, Mexico and Arizona; attacked
by cholera in the valley of the Rio Grande and
deserted by their leader, a remnant of the company chose
in his stead young Audubon, who bravely conducted
them to their destination. John Audubon returned in
the following year, after thirteen of the members of
the party and $27,000 had been lost in the venture.
</p>

<p>
Like a patriarch of old, as a friend had once pictured
him, Audubon passed the end of his days surrounded
by loving and able retainers, who, like "ministers of
state," were only too glad to execute his every wish.
Distinguished and handsome in age, appearing to many
older than he actually was, for years his snowy locks
and benign countenance attracted every passer on the
street, and for each he had a friendly look, word, or
greeting, until in him were fulfilled the words of the
Psalmist: "When thou art young thou goest whither
thou willest, but when thou art old another shall lead
thee, and thou shalt go whither thou willest not." On
the 27th of January, 1851, Jean Jacques Fougère Audubon
died, before attaining his sixty-seventh year, "as
gently as a child composing himself for his beautiful
sleep."

<p>
After the death of the elder Audubon, his sons, under
the leadership of Bachman, continued the work on the
<i>Quadrupeds</i> until the third and last volume of the letterpress
was completed in 1852. On March 13 of that
year Bachman wrote to Edward Harris:<a name='FA_229' id='FA_229' href='#FN_229' class='fnanchor'>[229]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Rejoice with me, the book is finished. I did not expect to
have lived to complete it. But Victor Audubon came on, and
I made him hold the pen, while I dictated with specimens and
books before me, and we went on rapidly; we worked hard,
and now we are at the end of our labors. I have, at last,
prevailed on them to give the Bats. At the end of the work,
I intend to give a synopsis and scientific arrangement of all
our American species, including seals, whales and porpoises.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
This will be included in the letter-press of the Third Volume.
</p>

<p>
Here I will venture to consult you in regard to the publication
of additional plates of species, not figured in the Large
Work. A very small Arvicola and Shrews, we may not obtain,
and they cannot be figured; but nearly all are within our reach.
Some of the subscribers have bound up their plates, and there
cannot be a sufficient number to make even half of another
Volume. I propose, as all these figures will be contained in
the <i>Small Work</i>, that they should be inserted in the letter-press
of the <i>Large Work</i>, so that subscribers, by merely paying the
cost of the small plates, would have the work complete—what
do you think of this?
</p>

<p>
What do you think of Victor's obtaining one hundred and
twenty-nine subscribers in about three days, and I think he
will double the number, next week; so, if the "Large Work"
will not pay, the "Small" one, and this is large enough, is sure
to do it.
</p>
</div>

<p>
When Victor was canvassing the South for the second
or composite edition of this work, Bachman wrote
to a friend in Savannah, on March 25, 1852:<a name='FA_230' id='FA_230' href='#FN_230' class='fnanchor'>[230]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My son-in-law, Victor G. Audubon, is on a rapid visit to
the South, and has a week or two to spare, which he is desirous
of devoting to the obtaining of subscribers to the
"American Quadrupeds." The Work (Miniature) will be complete
in about thirty numbers, furnished monthly at $1.00 per
number.
</p>

<p>
The figures were made by the Audubons, and the descriptions
and letter-press were prepared by myself.
</p>

<p>
I have no pecuniary interest in this work, as I have cheerfully
given my own labors without any other reward than
the hope of having contributed something toward the advancement
of the cause of Natural History in our country. I am,
however, anxious that the Audubons should, by a liberal subscription,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
receive some remuneration for the labors and heavy
expenses incurred in getting up this work. Of the character
of the work it does not become me to say much. I will only
add that in my department is summed up the result of investigations
pursued through a long life, and, I think, the figures
have never been equalled in any publication either in Europe
or America.
</p>

<p>
May I bespeak from you a little aid to my esteemed son-in-law,
Mr. Audubon, in assisting him to procure subscribers.
He is a stranger in your city; his time is limited, and his stay
among you will necessarily be short.
</p>

<p>
By the aid of two friends here, he obtained two hundred
and fifty subscribers in a few days.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the 9th of April Bachman wrote to his son-in-law:
"Will you not return to New York by the way of
Charleston and sail from here, take a manuscript volume
in your pocket, and four hundred good and true names
on your list?"
</p>

<p>
The reception accorded to the illustrations and text
of this work had encouraged the brothers to do for the
<i>Quadrupeds</i> what their father, with their aid, had so
successfully accomplished for the <i>Birds</i>, by presenting
text and plates, as Bachman said, in "Miniature." In
this they succeeded as admirably as before, John reducing
all the large plates, by the aid of the camera lucida,
for the octavo edition which was published in 1854.
</p>

<p>
The following historical evidence of the appreciation
which Audubon's works have received at the hands
of the National Government I owe to Mr. Ruthven
Deane, to whom the reader of these pages is already indebted
for many illuminating facts. Dr. Theodore S.
Palmer was recently inspecting governmental records
at Washington, when he accidentally came upon the following
entry:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>

copies, each, of Audubon's "Birds of America" and "Quadrupeds

<p>
In John Woodhouse Audubon's family there were
two sets of children, two by his former wife, Maria R.
Bachman, and seven by Caroline Hall, to whom he was
married on October 2, 1841. Victor Gifford Audubon,
who had no children by his first wife, May Eliza Bachman,
was married on March 2, 1843, to Georgiana Richards
Mallory, an Englishwoman, and six children were
born to them between 1845 and 1854. Of the naturalist's
fifteen grandchildren, six are believed to be now
living (1917).<a name='FA_231' id='FA_231' href='#FN_231' class='fnanchor'>[231]</a>

<p>
In 1852-3 Audubon's sons built houses for their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
growing families on their mother's estate; Victor's was
placed just north of the original homestead, and John's
not far away. On the slope behind John Audubon's
house, a small building, later known as the "Cave," was
specially constructed for the safer keeping of the famous
copper plates, which had already passed through fire,<a name='FA_232' id='FA_232' href='#FN_232' class='fnanchor'>[232]</a>
and not wholly unscathed. Mr. John Hardin, now
(1915) a serene and clear-eyed man of eighty-four, who
settled in that neighborhood in 1852 and who was intermittently
employed by the younger Audubons for a
decade, has told me that he boxed with his own hands
all of the copper plates, after wrapping each in tissue
paper, and stored them in that building; whenever John
Audubon wanted a plate, John Hardin would go to
the "Cave" and get it for him.
</p>

<p>
In 1856 Victor Audubon published a second reduced
edition of his father's <i>Birds of America</i>, in which the
text and plates of the first octavo were reproduced with
little or no change. At about that time Victor suffered
an injury to the spine,<a name='FA_233' id='FA_233' href='#FN_233' class='fnanchor'>[233]</a> and after 1857 he was completely
invalided; he died in his own home, August 18,
1860.
</p>

<p>
To quote the daughter of John W. Audubon:<a name='FA_234' id='FA_234' href='#FN_234' class='fnanchor'>[234]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
During this long period of my uncle's illness all the care
of both families devolved on my father. Never a "business
man," saddened by his brother's condition, and utterly unable
to manage, at the same time, a fairly large estate, the publication
of two illustrated works, every plate of which he felt he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
must personally examine, the securing of subscribers and the
financial condition of everything—what wonder that he rapidly
aged, what wonder that the burden was overwhelming! After
my uncle's death matters became still more difficult to handle,
owing to the unsettled condition of the southern states where
most of the subscribers to Audubon's books resided, and when
the open rupture came between north and south, the condition
of affairs can hardly be imagined, except by those who lived
through similar bitter and painful experiences.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1858 or 1859 John W. Audubon entered upon
an ambitious project, which the outbreak of the Civil
War, aided, it is believed, by the unscrupulous dealings
of business partners, rendered disastrous. In association
with Messrs. Roe Lockwood, &amp; Son, New York,
and the lithographers, Messrs. J. Bien &amp; Company,
Number 180 Broadway, with whom considerable money
had been invested, a second and American edition of his
father's great folio on <i>The Birds of America</i> was attempted.
An atlas of 106 double elephant plates, reproduced
in colors on stone with slight but numerous
changes from the original copper plates, was completed
as Volume I in 1860;<a name='FA_235' id='FA_235' href='#FN_235' class='fnanchor'>[235]</a> the war, which broke immediately
afterwards, completely ruined the enterprise, so
that but few copies of the work were dispersed and an
immense stock of plates was rendered useless; the burden
of debt was undoubtedly increased by the issue of seven
octavo volumes of text.<a name='FA_236' id='FA_236' href='#FN_236' class='fnanchor'>[236]</a>
</p>

<p>
Many years later, hundreds of persons who knew of
Audubon's work only through its great reputation, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
who had never learned to discriminate between a hand-colored
copper-plate engraving and a lithograph, were
deceived by an adroit, but essentially spurious advertisement
of these inferior reproductions when they were
being exploited by a firm of Boston book dealers. The
original bulk of these large lithographs must have been
vast indeed, if the following story, which was attributed
to a member of the firm in question, be true: "We bought
the entire stock of those plates, many years ago," so this
man is reported to have said, "and, though the sales of
every succeeding year since have been sufficient to cover
the original cost, the number of plates has not appreciably
diminished."
</p>

<p>
When this larger venture failed, one of the publishers,
who was not satisfied with the surplusage of
books and plates left on his hands, is said to have placed
encumbrances upon the Audubon estate. At about this
time John W. Audubon's health broke down; "Worn
out," as his daughter has said,<a name='FA_237' id='FA_237' href='#FN_237' class='fnanchor'>[237]</a> "in body and spirit, overburdened
with anxieties, saddened by the condition of
his country, it is no matter of surprise that my father
could not throw off a heavy cold which attacked him
early in 1862." He died at the age of forty-nine, on the
18th of February of that year.
</p>

<p>
John Woodhouse Audubon, like his brother, Victor,
had inherited decided artistic abilities, and from a youth
had been his father's assistant, field companion and
friend. Victor Audubon, on the other hand, was never
a field collector, but aided his father more in a financial
and secretarial capacity. Both in adult life were fond
of music and good cheer, and at one time John was
probably as devoted to adventure and sport as his father
had ever been in his palmiest days. One of his youthful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
pranks is thus guardedly referred to by the senior Audubon
when writing at American Harbor, on the coast of
Labrador, June 25, 1833:<a name='FA_238' id='FA_238' href='#FN_238' class='fnanchor'>[238]</a> "The young men, who
are always ready for sport, caught a hundred codfish in
half an hour, and <i>somewhere</i> secured three fine salmon,
one of which was sent to the 'Gulnare' with some cod."
Whether the fishermen at American Harbor, who had
obstinately refused to sell, ever missed those fine salmon
from their pounds, is not recorded. Another adventure
has been related by Mr. Fraser,<a name='FA_239' id='FA_239' href='#FN_239' class='fnanchor'>[239]</a> whose family was
on intimate terms with the Audubons and MacGillivrays
at Edinburgh, when John Audubon, John MacGillivray
(William MacGillivray's eldest son), and himself
were caught in the Ravelston woods while shooting
birds; the boys, he said "were rather roughly handled,"
but got off by giving up their guns.
</p>

<p>
Under his father's tuition John Audubon became
an observant and self-reliant collector in the field, and
an animal painter and draughtsman of no mean powers.
At twenty-one, as we have seen, he accompanied his
father's expedition to Labrador, was with him and Harris
in Florida and Texas in 1837, made successive visits
to England, and traveled again in Texas and in Mexico,
all in the interests of his father's works. He painted
nearly one-half of the large plates of the <i>Quadrupeds
of North America</i>, besides reducing all the drawings for
the smaller editions of the <i>Birds</i> and <i>Quadrupeds</i>, an
enormous labor in itself, representing the redrawing,
with numerous alterations, of 655 elaborate octavo
plates. After his return from California in 1850, he
began to bring out an account of his western travels,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
—projected for ten monthly numbers, but this never advanced
beyond the first part.<a name='FA_240' id='FA_240' href='#FN_240' class='fnanchor'>[240]</a>
</p>

<p>
If not a "business man" by instinct or training, John
Audubon in emergencies could turn his hand to many
things. For a time he superintended the building of
houses, including his own and Victor's, which were completed
in 1853, as well as another that was built on the
Audubon estate for Mr. Hall, a brother-in-law; he also
took charge of lighting the streets, and at another time
was superintendent of a quarry in Vermont. "He was
a bluff, gruff, but friendly man," writes George Bird
Grinnell,<a name='FA_241' id='FA_241' href='#FN_241' class='fnanchor'>[241]</a> and was always willing to talk about birds,
mammals, or, indeed, any natural history object, to any
boy who asked him questions." On the other hand, an
ardent sportsman, who had lived with the family for
years,<a name='FA_242' id='FA_242' href='#FN_242' class='fnanchor'>[242]</a> has described him as a lovable companion,
"genial in speech, full of anecdote, and a capital conversationalist;...
in person of more than median height,
and of commanding appearance, his face told plainly of
the humanity of the man; he was as tender-hearted as a
girl, and his expressive voice could command any key of
which the vocal organs were capable; to the last he retained
the Southern habit of softly clipping the ends of
words."
</p>

<p>
John Woodhouse Audubon will be remembered
chiefly as his father's aid and companion, although in
his <i>Western Journal</i>,<a name='FA_243' id='FA_243' href='#FN_243' class='fnanchor'>[243]</a> written in his thirty-eighth year
but not published until forty-two years after his death,
he has left a record of which anyone could be rightfully
proud.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. John James Audubon was very active in body
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
and mind for a long period after her husband's death,
and in 1857, when in her seventieth year, she returned
in a degree to her old vocation of school teaching, which
had been so successfully followed in Ohio and Louisiana
when her husband was on the threshold of his extraordinary
career. Her pupils now consisted of some of her
numerous grandchildren and a few others drawn from
the neighborhood; among the latter was the well known
writer and father of the original Audubon Society,
George Bird Grinnell, who pointed out to me the room
in Victor Audubon's old house where his revered
and venerable teacher had gathered her little flock. "She
loved to read, to study, and to teach," said one who
had known her, and "she knew how to gain the attention
of the young, and to fix knowledge in their minds.
'If I can hold the mind of a child to a subject for five
minutes, he will never forget what I teach him,' she once
remarked; and, acting upon this principle, she was as
successful, at three score and ten years, in imparting
knowledge, as she had been in early life when she taught
in Louisiana."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Audubon's own house was rented and eventually
sold. Meanwhile, it seems, she lived for a number
of years with the family of her eldest son, and it was at
Victor's house, as just noticed, that she started a small
school. Finally, in 1863, at the age of seventy-five,
bereft of children and fortune, she left the scenes of her
once happy home, then "Minnie's Land" no longer, and
for a considerable period lived with a granddaughter at
Washington Heights, as that section on the river, including
Carmansville, came to be called, and a little later
at Manhattanville, a short distance below; there at the
home of the Reverend Charles Coffin Adams, who prepared
the original draft of the <i>Life</i> of her husband, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
history of which has been given,<a name='FA_244' id='FA_244' href='#FN_244' class='fnanchor'>[244]</a> she passed a number
of years after 1865.
</p>

<p>
In a letter written to a relative from "Washington
Heights, N. Y., July 11, 1865," Mrs. Audubon spoke
thus of the present, while memories, not untinged with
sorrow, filled the retrospect:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
We have passed through a very cold winter which tried
both my Granddaughter ... and myself much. I have hoped
until I almost despair that [she] would have a short Holiday
so that we could go up to Hudson for a week and see you all
and mingle with those who sympathize and care for us, but in
a Boarding house, one seems a stranger in the world, and as I
pass my days alone generally from breakfast till our dinner
hour six o'clock evening when [my granddaughter] comes
home from her music Pupils of whom she has now ten, and from
that time I am glad when she is invited out to refresh her
mind.
</p>

<p>
I seldom leave home but to go up to see my other Grand
Daughter Lucy Williams, but being sixteen miles off we do
not go there often....
</p>

<p>
I have heard from my Sister Gordon lately of Orleans, she
has her Son at home! but they are likely to lose all their Property
on account of Sister's Son having been engaged in the
Confederate War. It does seem to me ... as if we were a
doomed family for all of us are in pecuniary difficulty more
or less. As to myself I find it hard to look back patiently
upon my great ignorance of business and the want of a wise
adviser who I now find could have saved me half the property
I have under errour and ignorance sacrificed and have just
enough left to keep us but not enjoy life by any travelling
about in this beautiful World. I sat on Sunday night after
Church on the Piazza, contemplating the beautiful Moon &amp; its
Creator, and I cannot yet say I wish to leave it, notwithstanding
all my disappointments and mortifications. Excuse this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
long detail about myself. I cannot help looking back as well as
to the present and future.
</p>
</div>

<p>
After Mrs. Audubon had passed her eightieth year
she left New York and again made her home in the
West. In 1874, when with a granddaughter at Louisville,
she dictated and signed the following letter to a
gentleman who had asked for an autograph of her husband:
</p>

<h4>
<i>Mrs. Audubon to William R. Dorlan</i>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>
</p>

<p>
I regret that your letter of Jan. 10th has remained so
long unanswered, but my granddaughter who usually writes
for me, is so constantly occupied with her pupils that until
to-day she has not been able to find time to write to you. I
regret that I cannot give you a letter of my husband <i>John
James Audubon</i> with the autograph attached.
</p>

<p>
The enclosed, the best I have to send you is one from
which the autograph and a portion of the letter were cut off
many years ago.

</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>
Mrs. Audubon's closing days were spent at the home
of her sister-in-law, Mrs. William G. Bakewell, at Shelbyville,
Kentucky, where she died, with her mental faculties
unimpaired, at the age of eighty-six, June 13,
1874, having outlived this sister-in-law and her younger
sisters, Mrs. Alexander Gordon, of New Orleans,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
and Mrs. Nicholas Augustus Berthoud, of St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
Not long after John W. Audubon's death, his family
disposed of their house on what had been the "Minnie's
Land" estate, and lived successively at Harlem,
New Haven, Connecticut, and Salem, New York, where
Mrs. John W. Audubon died, and where her daughter,
Maria Rebecca, the biographer of her father and grandfather,
with a sister, still resides. Victor Audubon's
family, with some of their kinsfolk, remained at the
Hudson River place, which was included in the section
known as "Audubon Park," until May, 1878, when they
took a house in New York, where Mrs. Victor Audubon
died in 1882.
</p>

<p>
A brother of Mrs. Victor Audubon, Mr. E. Mallory,
in writing to a friend in Buffalo from "Audubon Park,
August 31, 1874," said that it was a source of deep
regret to Mrs. John James Audubon that her last years
were not passed with them, under the shadow of her
old home on the Hudson; and he continued: "She was
a kind and good friend, very intelligent, and much beloved
here; I remember her telling a young lady, who
asked her if she had read some fashionable novel, that
she had no time; 'at my age,' said she, 'I must make
the most of my time.' As she was a wide reader, it was
a great trial when, in age, her eyesight completely failed
her. The minister who pronounced her eulogy<a name='FA_245' id='FA_245' href='#FN_245' class='fnanchor'>[245]</a> said:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Many of you can recall that aged form and benignant countenance,
as she moved along these streets upon errands of usefulness
and benevolence, with benedictions on her tongue, and
smiles that were a blessing to all who met her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Madame Audubon interested herself in all that pertained
to the welfare of the neighborhood where she lived. Although
it was not without a pang that she saw her sylvan home invaded
by the growth of the city, and all old associations broken
up, she did not treat those who came to live near her as
strangers. She had a large and generous heart, and with her
husband had always exercised a liberal hospitality and hearty
kindness towards all. In prosperity and adversity she was
equally sincere and humble, a friend of all worthy people....
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mrs. Audubon, during the period of her husband's
greatest activity, had traveled much and met people distinguished
in every walk of life. If, as some have
thought, when Audubon was struggling for recognition,
he was somewhat oblivious of the privations which his
wife endured, in the sunshine of later years, when fame
and fortune had smiled upon him, he showed by every
token of affection how fully he realized his debt. Let it
also be remembered that the monument by which Americans
have signalized their appreciation of his labors, is
honored by the ashes of his beloved Lucy, which rest by
his side.

<p>
The original drawings of the plates of <i>The Birds of
America</i> were sold by Mrs. Audubon on June 2, 1863,
to the Historical Society of New York,<a name='FA_246' id='FA_246' href='#FN_246' class='fnanchor'>[246]</a> and a few of
them are now displayed in its building in that city; it is
still hoped that a fire-proof and adequately lighted hall
can be constructed so that the whole of this great series
of pictures may be exhibited under more perfect conditions.
The artistic beauty and historical value of these
drawings, with the added charm which personal association
has so richly supplied, would render Audubon's
"Book of Nature" one of the most unique and interesting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
exhibits in the New World. The collection appears
to be nearly complete, although some notable pieces, such
as the Wild Turkeys, are lacking, but there are other
drawings, and some of early date, which were never reproduced;
all are inclosed in the original portfolios,
scarred by hard knocks and the tooth of time, massive,
leather-bound containers, which two strong arms would
raise with difficulty from the ground. Most of these
originals are mounted on a gray backing, with plate
margins in each case indicated by ink lines. As was noticed
in an earlier chapter, many original legends and
notes written by Audubon's pencil or pen still remain
on the drawings, though many have been trimmed off
or erased; these include names of localities and dates,
and directions to the engraver for changes in the background
and composition or for any improvement of
the whole or a part.
</p>

<p>
As a further illustration of the care which Audubon
exercised over the minute details of his great undertaking,
we will reproduce the penciled orders on the drawing
of the Great White Heron (Plate cclxxxi), which
shows an adult male performing the gymnastic feat of
seizing a large striped fish, a view of Key West forming
the background: "Keep closely to the sky in depth &amp;
colouring! have the water a <i>Pea-green</i> tint. Keep the
division of the scales on the leg in fact white in your
engraving—The colouring over these will subdue them
enough! finish the houses better from the original which
you have; have the upper back portion very mellowing
in the outline." Again, on the drawing of the Great
Cinereous Owl (Plate cccli), we read: "Raise the bird
about 4 inches on the copper—higher than in the Drawing,
and put in a landscape below of Wild Mountains,"
a direction which in this instance was not followed, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
the bird was eventually shown on a branch against the
sky.
</p>

<p>
In many instances towards the end of his work,
Audubon furnished Havell with drawings of the birds
only, with directions to supply "an old rotten stick" for
perch, or to "amend this rascally sky and water"; as we
have already seen, he often depended upon him to combine
several detached pictures into one plate, but not
always with happy results. The following note was
written on a drawing of the Carolina Parrot, reproduced
in a very striking plate (No. xxvi), in which seven
gaudy individuals of this nearly extinct species are represented
feeding on a favorite weed, the cockle-bur:
"The upper specimen was shot near Bayou Sarah, and
appeared as very uncommon having 14 Tail feathers all
very distinct—uniformly affixed in 14 distinct receptacles
that I drew it more to exhibit one of those astonishing
fits of nature than anything else—it was a female.—The
Green headed is also a Singular although not so
uncommon a variety as the above one. Louisiana—December
(1821?) J. J. Audubon." The upper bird,
which is here referred to, is noticed in his "Biography"
of the species as "a kind of occasional variety."
</p>

<p>
On the drawing of the Swamp Sparrow (Plate lxiv),
which was published in 1829, Audubon wrote, evidently
with the wish of having his wife's name appear: "Drawn
from Nature by Lucy Audubon, Mr. Havell will please
have Lucy Audubon name on this plate instead of
mine...!"
</p>

<p>
Vandalism is always short-sighted, but seldom has its
vision been more myopic and sinister than in the case of
the copper plates of <i>The Birds of America</i>, most of
which were sold for old metal and converted into copper
bars. Had they been preserved to this day, their value
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
would have been an hundred-fold greater than that of
the few paltry tons of metallic copper which they were
supposed to represent. Mr. Ruthven Deane, whose researches
in the field of "Auduboniana" have added
greatly to this subject, has given a history of these
plates,<a name='FA_247' id='FA_247' href='#FN_247' class='fnanchor'>[247]</a> and of the interesting way in which a remnant
came to be snatched, as it were, from the very mouth of
the furnace, through the persistence and enthusiasm of
a lad of fourteen. To follow this writer's account, it
seems that shortly after the death of her son John, Mrs.
Audubon sold the copper plates to a firm in New York,
where they remained until about 1865, stored in the
warehouse of Messrs. Phelps, Dodge &amp; Company. Not
far from that time the plates were sorted and a few were
given away; the large remainder was sent to a brass and
copper company, of which William E. Dodge was president,
at Ansonia, Connecticut. How some of these
were fortunately rescued, in about the year 1873, is told
in a letter to Mr. Deane from Mr. Charles A. Cowles, of
Ansonia:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At that time I was about fourteen years old. I was beginning
the study of taxidermy, and was naturally deeply interested
in birds. I happened to be at the refinery watching
the process of loading one of the furnaces, and noticed on one
of the sheets of copper that a man was throwing into the
furnace, what appeared to me to be the picture of a bird's
foot. I took the plate from him, cleaned it with acid, and
thereupon discovered the engraving, or as I termed it, the picture,
of a bird (Plate cvi, Black Vulture), I made an immediate
but unsuccessful request to the foreman of the furnace
not to melt the plates; and then I appealed to the superintendent,
but without avail. I next brought the matter to the
general manager of the concern, my father, from whom I received
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
no encouragement. This sort of treatment was evidently
what I needed, for I hastened back to the works in a state of
mind so determined that I succeeded in having all the plates,
that had not been melted, removed to a place of safety. This
occurred in the spring of that year; and the plates remained
undisturbed until the annual inventory was taken the first of
the following year. At that time the disposition of the plates
was taken up. I appealed to my mother and interested her
to such an extent that she drove to the factory and looked at
one of the plates. She of course recognized that they were
Audubon plates; and instructions were given by my father to
keep them intact.  The plates were subsequently submitted
to a treatment which removed all oxidation and then taken to
the main office of the company, and to the best of my recollection,
distributed as follows: Mr. Wm. E. Dodge, president of
the company, had a few plates sent to the American Museum
of Natural History, New York City, and a few plates to the
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C., and I think he
retained one or two for himself. The remainder of them, with
the exception of two, my father kept; and they have since come
into my possession by purchase from the estate.  The two
plates just excepted were Nos. xxii and lxxxii [Purple Martin
and Whippoorwill], and they particularly struck my fancy,
so much that when the plates were first discovered I managed to
secure them on the quiet, cleaned them myself and hid them;
and when the plates were distributed no one knew of the existence
of these two and they later became my property.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was thought possible that some of these plates had
been sold in New York City before the bulk of them
were condemned as junk and sent to Connecticut, but in
1898 Mr. Deane was able to give the designation and
resting place of only thirty-seven;<a name='FA_248' id='FA_248' href='#FN_248' class='fnanchor'>[248]</a> among these, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
were the Wild Turkeys, Canada Goose, Great
Northern Diver, Raven, American Robin, and Ruby-throated
Hummingbird, all among the finest of the original
435.
</p>

<p>
Under the guidance of Mr. George Bird Grinnell,
on April 6, 1916, I paid a visit to "Audubon Park,"
now "Minnie's Land" no longer, where country roads
have given way to business streets and forests to subways
and skyscraper apartment houses. Notwithstanding
the momentous changes which the extension of upper
New York City has effected both above and below
ground during the recent era of rapid transportation,
the old Audubon houses still remain, like boulders amid
stream, the impact of the city which has flowed around
and beyond them being checked for the moment by a
rampart of solid masonry, the retaining wall of the far-famed
Riverside Drive, which rises above Audubon's
old house close to its rear veranda and there makes
a wide turn. For Mr. Grinnell this was a return to the
scenes of his boyhood; the home of his father, Mr.
George Blake Grinnell, stood on the hill just above the
Audubon house, not far from the present "Riviera"
building at One Hundred and Fifty-Seventh Street; the
Grinnell apartment house which towers aloft close at
hand stands in their old cow pasture, while their garden
site is marked by the present entrance to the subway
station on Broadway.
</p>

<p>
The first part of Audubon's original tract to be sold
was the easterly section, extending from what is now
the east side of Broadway to the Bloomingdale Road,
and between the present One Hundred and Fifty-sixth
and One Hundred and Fifty-seventh Streets; on that
portion John Woodhouse Audubon built a large frame
structure which, for a number of years, served as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
boarding house for workmen employed in the sugar
refinery of Messrs. Plume &amp; Lamont that stood on the
river-bank, at the foot of the present One Hundred
and Sixtieth Street. Victor and John W. Audubon
also built three houses on the hill, one of which, between
One Hundred and Fifty-sixth and One Hundred and
Fifty-seventh Streets, was occupied by Mr. Grinnell;
another, at one time the dwelling of Henry A. Smythe,
a former Collector of the Port of New York, was on
land now covered by the Numismatic Building, while a
third, which was occupied by Wellington Clapp, was on
a part of the Archer M. Huntington estate, south of
One Hundred and Fifty-sixth Street, and stood a little
easterly of the present Riverside Drive; all of these
houses have disappeared. In September, 1842, the Corporation
of Trinity Parish acquired from Richard F.
Carman, in Carmansville, the tract of land later known
as "Trinity Cemetery"; this extended from Bloomingdale
Road to the River, and between the present One
Hundred and Fifty-third and One Hundred and Fifty-fifth
Streets.<a name='FA_249' id='FA_249' href='#FN_249' class='fnanchor'>[249]</a>
</p>

<p>
The original Audubon house, standing in the angle
nearly opposite One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street, is
all but concealed, except from the river side, but may
be approached by a lane which leads off from One Hundred
and Fifty-eighth Street. In 1913, when this old
landmark was in imminent danger of demolition, the
Commissioner of Public Parks made an eloquent plea
for its preservation to the Audubon Societies and to
lovers of birds and nature everywhere. It was then
suggested that instead of permitting the historic structure
to be destroyed, the city should acquire it, float it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
up the Hudson River to Fort Washington Park, and re-establish
it there as a permanent memorial to the naturalist;
it was also noticed that the public interest was enhanced
by the fact that the father of telegraphy, Samuel
F. B. Morse, had worked upon his invention while Audubon's
guest, and that the first message to be received
from Philadelphia came over a wire which entered his
room at the northwest corner of the building.
</p>

<p>
An early engraving<a name='FA_250' id='FA_250' href='#FN_250' class='fnanchor'>[250]</a> represents the naturalist's
house essentially as it appeared during his lifetime, surrounded
by goodly forest trees of oak and chestnut, but
these, when standing at all, are now reduced to gaunt
and scarred remnants. A later print<a name='FA_251' id='FA_251' href='#FN_251' class='fnanchor'>[251]</a> shows the
three Audubon houses, the river, and between it and the
lawn "that eye-sore of a railroad,"<a name='FA_252' id='FA_252' href='#FN_252' class='fnanchor'>[252]</a> which was built not
long after Audubon settled upon his estate. The original
house was sold before 1862,<a name='FA_253' id='FA_253' href='#FN_253' class='fnanchor'>[253]</a> and about eight years
later its new owner occupied it, after having given it a
mansard roof and made numerous changes which were
sanctioned by an era of bad taste. The naturalist's house
overlooked the river and commanded a grand view from
its high veranda on the front, while Victor's, which later
adjoined it to the north, owing probably to the encroachments
of the railroad, was built to face the hill-slope
opposite; a top studio, at a corner of its roof, is an
addition of a later purchaser.<a name='FA_254' id='FA_254' href='#FN_254' class='fnanchor'>[254]</a>
</p>

<p>
Adjoining Victor's house on the north was that of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
brother, John, and on the east side of this was built the
"Cave" and a barn since converted into a dwelling; at
one time the loft of this barn was piled with boxes of
bird skins and the surplus stock of the <i>Ornithological
Biography</i>, good copies of which now bring from $30 to
$50.
</p>

<p>
The three houses which were built and occupied by
the great nature lover and his two sons, though in dire
neglect, are not beyond repair; if such a project were
practicable, they should be converted into a museum,
and their walls once more ornamented with those beautiful
pictures of birds and beasts which father and sons
united to create. The triangle of ground between Riverside
Drive and the Hudson River should be spared by
the proud city that for years was the home of America's
pioneer naturalist and animal painter, as well as the
scene of his youthful experiments in trade, and converted
into a true "Audubon Park." Such a memorial
would contribute to the instruction and pleasure of all
the people, for every generation of Americans that is
to come.

<span class="smcap">NOTE BY THE AUTHOR.</span> This record proves that Audubon upon his first
return to France from the United States, must have left "Mill Grove" on
the 12th of January, 1805, or not more than a day later; three days were required
to walk to New York, which could not have been reached later than
the 15th, and probably as many more were needed for a letter to go to
"Fatland Ford." He probably sailed for Nantes shortly before January
18, the day when William Bakewell recorded that he had sent his "brother,"
Benjamin Bakewell, commission merchant in New York, $150; this was undoubtedly
in payment of the loan which the brother in New York had
made to young Audubon for his passage to France. The next item, of
April 22, 1807, was for money advanced to Ferdinand Rozier, probably
when he was acting as clerk to Laurence Huron, in Philadelphia; "advertisements
in Philadelphia and Norristown" possibly had reference to
the lease and final sale of "Mill Grove" of the year before. Miers Fisher
was the Quaker merchant, who for many years served as Lieutenant Audubon's
American agent and attorney, and who was later the adviser of his
son and Ferdinand Rozier. Thomas W. Pears, a relative by marriage of
the Bakewells, was with Audubon in Benjamin Bakewell's office in New
York, and afterwards associated with him and Thomas W. Bakewell in
their disastrous mill experiment at Henderson, Kentucky. The bill of
William Thomas, former Quaker tenant of "Mill Grove," was possibly in
liquidation of his claim against Lieutenant Audubon and Dacosta in their
mining operations at this farm (see the letters to Dacosta, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58983/58983-h/58983-h.htm#Page_117">Vol. I, p. 117</a>).
The credit entry under May 12, 1808, "formon—31.84," may represent interest
collected on an unsettled claim of Lieutenant Audubon against Mr.
Formon, a former partner in Santo Domingo, in relation to the sale of the
ships, the <i>Count of Artois</i> and the <i>Annette</i> (see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58983/58983-h/58983-h.htm#Page_33">Chapter II, p. 33</a>).
Dacosta had been urged to apply to Mr. Formon's son-in-law, who appears
to have lived at Philadelphia, but was unable to obtain anything from the
Formon estate. The "Cash of Dacosta 299.44" possibly represented interest
on the mortgage which we have assumed was given to Audubon and
Rozier when Dacosta and his mining company came into possession of
"Mill Grove," September 15, 1806 (see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58983/58983-h/58983-h.htm#Page_148">Chapter XI, p. 148</a>).

We, Germain Vallin, Mayor of the commune of Coueron in

to all whom it may concern, that on this day, personally appeared

both now residing in this said commune, and represented to

written on the other side hereof, in the English language,
which they have declared to be a letter of attorney in favor
of Messieurs Ferdinand Rozier, &amp; John Audubon, junior for

Instrument be by them acknowledged before us, according to

We, the undersigned, Ferdinand Rozier and John
Audubon, who are intending to go to the United
States, are agreed to form a partnership in business
upon the following conditions:
</p>

<p class="center">
Article First.
</p>

<p>
The partnership will be administered under the
joint names of Ferdinand Rozier and John Audubon,
and each of us will have the power of signature
for all matters of our business only.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 2.
</p>

<p>
Upon our arrival we will take possession of the farm of
Mill-Grove, and we will call to account Mr. Dacosta, who has
the power of attorney of Mr. Audubon, Senior. We shall take
measures to improve the establishment, or make an investigation
of the lead mine discovered [on the property], and before
continuing the work already begun we will ascertain whether
the expenditures made by S<span class="sup">r</span>. Dacosta, have been, and can still
be, advantageous to us. Finally we shall prepare, or attempt
to prepare, estimates of the expenses and the products which
accrue from these, and we shall undertake nothing upon which
we are not both perfectly agreed in principle; consequently
we shall both subscribe to the project which we shall decide
upon, in order that neither of us may depart from it, and it will
be the same for all new expenses which might alter the plans
that are reached.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 3.
</p>

<p>
It is agreed that half the product of this plantation shall
be divided between us on a one half basis, and in order to
recognize this [profit], as well as the loss, we shall keep a
special book for the purpose; on one side shall be entered the
items of expense, day by day, and, at the moment this is done,
on the other side [shall also be given] the sales and products
of the farms, and of all that can result from this business,
in such a way that the profit shall be always apparent by the
addition of the items which compose the debit and the credit.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 4.
</p>

<p>
The house above mentioned [Mill-Grove farmhouse] shall
be an object separate from all business, in order that we may
settle matters as completely as we desire. It is agreed that
we shall add to the expenses of this exploitation, those necessary
for life, and others of a common character, so long as it
shall suit us to live and dwell together.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 5.
</p>

<p>
We cannot be prevented from engaging in any other kind
of business, but before undertaking it we shall remain six months
in order to gather from the country information of a kind
that would be advantageous to us; we shall then apply ourselves
to some commercial occupation, whether inland or maritime.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 6.
</p>

<p>
We are both at liberty to make any journey in order to
procure information, and should it happen that we persuade
any merchants to send goods to Mr. Rozier, Senior, we would
establish the condition that the benefit which might result from
these consignments would be divided between us and the M<span class="sup">r</span>.
F. Rozier, Senior.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 7.
</p>

<p>
All the benefits as well as the losses resulting from our
commercial transactions shall be divided equally between the
partners.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 8.
</p>

<p>
The expenses of the journey and others of a common nature
shall make the first item of our social expenses....
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 9.
</p>

<p>
We both resolve to maintain friendship and mutual understanding,
and we agree very expressly that, upon the least
difficulty, we shall each select one arbitrator, who will be authorized
to choose a third, and we promise upon our honor to
fully accept the decision that shall be reached, without ever
having it in our power to make an appeal from it before any
courts.
</p>

<p class="center">
Art. 10.
</p>

<p>
In case of the death of one or the other (which, God forbid),
the survivor shall have sole charge of making a settlement,
in order to give an accounting to those entitled to it by
law, that is to say to the heirs of the deceased, but the partnership
cannot be dissolved until after nine years, counting
from the day of the date of the present [instrument]. Only
in this event, the survivor will be allowed a commission upon
the products of the establishment fixed at ten per cent.

Sous plusiers rapports que votre précédente, mais enfin
il faut espérer que l'item vous prouvera que votre dernier sillon
ne sera point déserteur, et que les occides de fer qui se trouvent
se dissiperont en fouillant plus avant, an moins c'est ce que
je désire, vous faites bien de faire tous vos efforts pour avoir
des associés &amp; Si cela ne réussit pas, &amp; que vous vouliez
travailler pour notre compte Je trouverai toujours bon, tout
ce que vous ferez, puisque vous avez ma confiance dans ce cas
je crois que vous s... igé[?], de faire faire des reparations
les plus urgentes Surtout à la maison principale, Devant
vous y loger. Quand à M<span class="sup">r</span> W. Thomas, vous ferez bien de vous
le garder, pour toutes les raisons, que vous me dites &amp; Je crois
qu'il ne doit pas sopiniatrer à se retirer, qu'il ne sache, s'il à
mérité, oui ou non, sa récompense.
</p>

<p>
Je suis M<span class="sup">r</span>. on ne peut plus faché de ce que vous ayez à vous
plaindre, de la conduite de mon fils, car le tout, bien considéré
n'est occasionné, que par de mauvais conseils &amp; un deffaut
d'usage on a aiguillonné son amour propre, et peut être avait-il
été assez jeune pour se vanter, dans la maison ou il va que cette
plantation devait lui echoir, à lui seul; vous avez tous les
moyens de detruire cette présomption, on n' ignore point a
philadelphie, que vous avez autant de droits que moi &amp; que vous
ne faites rien que pour notre mutuel avantage.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>371</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Je lui ecris a ce sujet, car il ne men parle point, et je
lui donne la cémonce que mérite son indiscrétion; vous lirez
cette lettre et voudrez bien avoir la complaisance de la cacheter
avant de lui remettre. Vous me dites que je puis m'en rapporter
sur son compte an rapport que m'en fait M<span class="sup">r</span>. Meyers
fisher, dans sa longue lettre du mois de Septembre que
Malheureusement je n'ai pas reçu, car M<span class="sup">r</span> fisher, ne me parle
point de lui, ni en bien, ni en mal. Quand à venir dans le pays,
cela me parraît presqu'impossible, rappeller mon fils n'est pas
plus aisé, les raisons qui me l'en fait l'envoyer existent toujours;
il ne faut qu'un instant pour le faire changer du mal au bien,
sa grande jeunesse et sa pétulance sont tous ses torts et si vous
avez la Bonté de lui donner l'indispensable, il sentira bientot
la Nécessité de se rapprocher de vous et pourra vous être d'une
grande utilité, si vous exploitez par vous même.
</p>

<p>
Il faut donc Mon cher monsieur, que nous tachions de le
ramener par la douceur à son Devoir. Si vous avez de l'indulgence
pour lui ce sera moi qui vous en aurai toute l'aubligation;
j'espere  que la lettre cy-jointe operera chez lui un changement.
C'est mon seul fils, mon heritier, &amp; je suis vieux. Quand
M<span class="sup">r</span> Meiers fisher aura montré ma lettre au prétendu beaupere,
il verra qu'il s'est trompé dans son calcul sur le prétendu
Mariage de sa fille, car s'il avait lieu sans mon consentement
tout secours de ma part cesserait des cet instant; et c'est ce
que vous pouvez bien si vous voulez avoir cette bonté, dire
an prétendu beau pere, ne voulant pas que mon fils se marie
aussi jeune; vos lettres du 28 Octobre &amp; 12 Novembre sont à
la campagne. Je ne puis point répondre categoriquement sur
leurs contents; Je les examinerai &amp; vous dirai par ma prochaine
ce que J'en pense. Votre famille que J'ai vu se porte bien. Nos
dames vous rémercient de votre bon souvenir. Je suis &amp;.

Je profite d'une bonne occasion pour Bordeaux pour vous
accuser reception d'un Duplicats des pouvoirs que nous vous
demandai plusieurs mois passes. Vous saurez aussi que les vins
consignes a M. L. Huron de Philadelphia sont arrives en cette
ville et ont sauves les assurances; votre fils s'est transporte sur
la place et par une de ses lettres m'apprend que les 60 caisses
sont vendues il me dit que vous pouvez compter sur un profit
net d'a peu pres 20 p. ct. s'il s'est trouve tres bons et le reste
ne manquera de trouver acheteur: M<span class="sup">r</span>. Le Ray est arrive et
a apporte avec lui une petite Boite de dentelles pour M. Benjamin
Bakewell d'icy elle doit arriver en peu de jours de Philadelphia.
M<span class="sup">r</span>. B. B. a paru satisfait de la vente de son Bois
Futtie. il lui tarde seulement de voir les retours il est malheureux
que le commerce de votre ville avec ce pays ne soye pas aussi
regulierement suivi qu'a Bordeaux d'ou nous avons des Batiments
tous les mois et par plusieurs. Comme notre ami Ferdinand
vous ecriva de Philadelphia concernant M<span class="sup">r</span>. Huron je
ne m'ettendray pas sur son compte: dans plusieurs de vos
Lettres que si nous nous decidions obtenir un magasin de detail
que vous pourriez nous tenir constamment employe nos idees
sur ce sujet sont parfaitement d'accord et ce serait avec bien
du plaisir que nous commenserions sous auspices et les bons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
avis de Mr. Bakewell ici; les objects bien choisis bien achette
et envoye avec soins sont toujours sur de rencontrer un bon
marche: j'ose esperer que le Navire la Jeanne Capt Sammis
sera arrive a votre port et que les Indigos charges par M. B.
Bakewell pourront y etre venu en temp de vente de cette marchandise
dont j'ai neanmoins quelque crainte vu le prix qu'ils
lui avaient coute. Nous vous remercions sincerement pour le
prix courant que vous nous avez envoye, dans une de mes
dernieres ecrite par voye de Bordeaux je vous priais de demander
a M<span class="sup">r</span>. Fleury Emery une boite de graines de la Martinique
et de se pays cy. nous esperons sous peu vous envoyer
quelque marchandises et peut etre M<span class="sup">r</span>. Bakewell profitera d'une
occasion que nous allons avoir en peu de jour pour votre port.
A peu plus trois semaines passees Je fus a Mill Grove et
l'affermais pour un an ne pouvant faire mieux pour le present.
Votre fils a Philadelphia a present va essayer de terminer les
comptes de mon pere avec M<span class="sup">r</span>. Dacotta [Dacosta] qui n'oublie
pas aisement d'etre chicanneur... presentez Je vous prie
mes respects et amities a votre bonne famille et epouse et croyez
en moi comme votre devoue

<span class="smcap">Mon cher Rozier</span>:—
</p>

<p>
Come il est presque probable que l'occasion que je trouve
est sur, je suis avec elle le plaisir de t'écrire quelque mots—
</p>

<p>
Je reçus en temps ta lettre envoyé a Phil<span class="sup">a</span> a lequelle je repondis
alors; depuis je n'ai entendu de tes nouvelles que par
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
voies très indirectes, je serais bien content si tu peux donner
quelques instants a tes amis que tu me compte aux nombre et
m'écrire par temps; je partis avec ma femme et mon fils de
Phil<span class="sup">a</span> au mois passé, la plus grande parties de ce temps a été
à descendre L'Ohio qui est actuellement très bas nous avons eu
la Barge et L'Equipage du G<span class="sup">l</span> Clark, avec la compagnie de M<span class="sup">r</span>
R. A. Maupin et de M<span class="sup">de</span> Gait qui avaient rester plusieurs mois
a New York &amp; a Phil<span class="sup">a</span>. Je vais probablement descendre a la
N. Orléans cet autumn avec N. Berthoud, les merchandizes sont
extremement rare et très chere, partout, mais plus encore les
gros Lainages que l'on ne trouve du tout.
</p>

<p>
Je n'ai pas de doute que ton plomb ne se vende tres bien
cet article ayant augmenté considerablement depuis la guerre.—dans
les derniers jours que j'etais dans l'Est j'ai recu une lettre
de mon père et une de ton frère toute ta famille se portait alors
bien dit 4 mois passés, ton frère desire beaucoup entendre de
toi, si la paix vient un jour non bien loin (ce qu'à Dieu plaise)
j'espere entrer en liaison avec lui.
</p>

<p>
Je lui est écrit et l'engage a faire de même tes lettres
pouront se rendre si envoyers a N. York et de la dans la Cartel.
Ma femme se porte bien et mon fils sois de même et compte au
nombre de tes amis est ce que dison celui qui t'estimera toujours.

Among the drawings of the Harris-Jeanes collection which
may be earlier than 1805, though they bear no date, are "The
Black Crow of Buffon, Corneille noire," also the head of a Jackdaw
wholly in crayon and pastel: "No. 160, Le grand Duc,
âgé vingt un an, Buffon,—the large horned owl, Eagle owl.
J. J. L. Audubon," a crayon sketch on paper measuring
eighteen by twenty-six inches, and water-marked "J. Kool";
also "No. 164. La corneille mantelle de Buffon, Royalton
crow, Sea crane, hooded crow, crow—British,—J. J. L. Audubon,"
a crude sketch in pastels of the same size as the last.
</p>

<p>
The following legends appear on the drawing of the Canvasback
Duck: "Cet Oiseau est nommé Canvas Back Canard
very much esteemed par les Americans and very rare ici
[c]elui est male et étais beau"; "New York le 22 Mars 1807—J.
J. L. Audubon" "No. 146."

PROSPECTUS.
</p>

<p>
To those who have not seen any portion of the Author's
splendid Collection of Original Drawings it may be proper to
explain, that their superiority consists in every specimen being
of the full size of life, portrayed with a degree of accuracy as
to proportion and outline, the result of peculiar means discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_387' name='Page_387' href='#Page_387'>387</a></span>
and employed by the Author, and lately exhibited to
a meeting of the Wernerian Society. Besides, in every instance
where a difference of plumage exists between the two sexes,
both the Male and Female Birds have been represented. The
Author has not contented himself with single profile views of
the originals, but in very many instances he has grouped them,
as it were, at their natural avocations, in all sorts of attitudes,
either on branches of trees, or amidst plants and flowers: some
are seen pursuing with avidity their prey through the air, or
searching diligently their food amongst the fragrant foliage;
whilst others of an aquatic nature swim, wade, or glide over
their allotted element. The Insects, Reptiles, or Fishes, that
form the food of the birds, have been introduced into the drawings;
and the nests of the birds have been frequently represented.
The Plants are all copied from Nature, and the
Botanist, it is hoped, will look upon them with delight. The
Eggs of most of the species will appear in the course of the
publication.
</p>

<p>
The Particulars of the Plan of the Work will be found detailed
below:—
</p>

<p class="phanging">
1. The Engravings in every instance to be of the exact dimensions
of the Drawings, which, without any exception,
represent the Birds of their natural size.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
2. The Plates will be Coloured, in the most careful manner,
from the original Drawings.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
3. The Size of the work will be Double Elephant, and printed
on the finest Drawing Paper.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
4. Five Plates will constitute a Number; one Plate from one
of the largest Drawings, one from one of the second
size, and three from the smaller Drawings.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
5. There are 400 Drawings; and it is proposed that they shall
comprise Three Volumes, each containing about 133
Plates, to which an Index will be given at the end of
each, to be bound up with the Volume.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
6. Five Numbers will come out annually.
</p>

<p class="phanging">
7. The Price of each Number will be Two Guineas; payable
on delivery.
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
</p>

<p>
TEN Numbers being now completed, will give an exact idea
of the nature and style of the Work. All the other Numbers
will at least equal these in interest and execution. It would
be advisable for the Subscribers to procure a Portfolio, to keep
the Numbers till a Volume is completed.
</p>

<p>
⁂Persons desirous of becoming Subscribers are requested
to apply to Mr. Audubon, or Mr. Robert Havell, Jun. (Engraver),
79, Newman Street, Oxford Street, London.

<span class="smcap">Note by the Author.</span> Audubon's first Prospectus was issued on March
17, 1827, when two Numbers of his large work were ready, and the last
which I have seen bears the date of 1831, when one hundred plates had been
published. The present citation is from a copy in possession of the Boston

AUDUBON'S<br />
Celebrated Work<br />
BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA<br />

To be published in Numbers, by Subscription only,
at one half the original price.
</p>

<p>
The undersigned proposes to publish, by Subscription,
this well-known Work of his late Father, J. J. Audubon,
F.R.SS.L.&amp;E., etc., from the original Copperplates transferred
to stone.
</p>

<p>
This Edition, in softness, finish, and correctness of coloring,
will be superior to the first, and every Plate will be colored
from the original Drawings, still in possession of the
family.
</p>

<p>
It will contain all the Plates and Text of the original
Work, embracing more than one thousand figures of Birds,
all of the size of nature, represented in action amid the scenes
or on the plants most common to their habits,—together with
seven volumes royal octavo, of Ornithological Biography.
</p>

<p>
The Work will be issued in forty-five numbers viz., forty-four
of Plates and one of Text, each number of Plates containing
ten—printed on seven sheets double-elephant paper,
of the best quality for the purpose, 27 by 40 inches, and will
be delivered to Subscribers Monthly, at £2, 8s. per number;
the last Number, comprising seven volumes of Text, to be delivered
bound with the fifteenth number.
</p>

<p>
It is intended that each Number shall contain as follows:
Viz. two large Plates, each occupying the whole sheet; two
of a medium size, each occupying also the entire sheet; and
six of the smaller size, two Plates on a sheet; thus presenting
ten of the original Plates on seven sheets, giving a variety in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
each number. The text is properly and scientifically classified,
and when the Work shall be completed the Plates can be placed
and be bound corresponding with the order of the Text, in
either three or four Volumes. The regular issue of the Numbers
will commence so soon as the number of Subscribers will
justify the undertaking.
</p>

<p>
As the Work will be published for Subscribers alone, few
or none being printed beyond the number subscribed for, it is
not possible that its pecuniary value can ever be much reduced;
on the other hand, the probabilities are that it will rather
be increased. Nor will there ever be a time when it can be
published at a less price than the present; for in estimating
the cost the mere expense of manufacturing has been taken
into consideration, without reference to the original cost of
the Copper-plates, which was nearly One hundred thousand
Dollars; and a very small profit has been charged on the expense
thus estimated.
</p>

<p>
The first Number is considered superior in many respects
to the same Plates in the first Edition, and it is confidently
hoped that subsequent Numbers will exhibit still greater
superiority as the Artists gain experience. A full list of Subscribers
will be published with the Work. The Numbers will
not be sold separately, except the first, which will be sent,
properly packed, as a Specimen, to any part of the country,
free of expense, on the receipt of £2, 8s.

<p>
<span class="smcap">Note by the Author.</span> For the citation of this rare document, from the
only copy known to exist, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Ruthven
Deane, who writes: "I found this Prospectus bound in the first volume of
<i>The Ibis</i> (1859). This copy was previously in possession of the late Pierre
Verreaux, of Paris, France, and is now in the John Crerar Library, Chicago,
Illinois."
</p>

<p>
Ornithologists will be pleased to find that it immediately sets at rest
numerous disputed questions concerning the plates and text of this sole, but
ill-fated, attempt at the republication of the original folio of <i>The Birds of
America</i> in America. (See Bibliography, Nos. <a href="#Bibliography_9">9</a> and <a href="#Bibliography_10">10</a>, and <a href="#Page_296">Chapter
XXXVI, p. 296</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ruthven Deane has written me that an examination of the account
books kept by the Audubons during the publication of the large and small
editions of <i>The Birds of America</i> showed partial payments on the Folio by
23 subscribers; the only name among those not listed in the <i>Ornithological
Biography</i> was that of J. R. Peters, who was credited with a payment of
$412.00. Mr. Deane adds: "I have a list of the subscribers to the 1840,
8vo., edition, of 1,095 names, New York, Baltimore and Boston taking 501;
also a list of subscribers to the <i>Quadrupeds of North America</i>, 3 volume,
8vo., edition, of 2,004 names, New York, Boston and Charleston, South
Carolina, taking 1,102."

APPENDIX IV
<br />
<span class="smcap s08">Authentic Likenesses of Jean Jacques Fougère Audubon</span>
</h2>

<p class="plist">
1. <i>1824.</i>—Oil portrait by himself; painted at "Beech
Grove," William Garrett Johnson's plantation,
West Feliciana, Louisiana; presented by
Audubon to Mrs. Johnson; inherited by her
daughter and granddaughter, and now in possession
of Dr. D. G. Murrell, Paducah, Kentucky.
Size of original, 12 by 9 inches. Reproduced
in <i>The Auk</i>, vol. iii, 1886 (see Bibliography,
<a href="#Bibliography_184">No. 184</a>).
</p>

<p class="plist">
2. <i>1826</i> (?).—Oil portrait by himself (?), 18 by 32 inches,
West Feliciana; presented by Audubon to Col.
Edward Durrive's father, later acquired by
Mr. E. Curtis, and now in the possession of
Mr. Thomas P. Thompson, New Orleans.
</p>

<p>
My information concerning this doubtful portrait has been
derived entirely from Mr. Ruthven Deane, to whom its present
owner recently wrote: "My Audubon, by himself, attracts
much interest, and grows more real as time makes it familiar."

</p>

<p class="plist">
4. <i>1826</i> (?).—Oil portrait by W. H. Holmes, 36 by 28
inches; painted for Audubon's friend, Walter
Horton Bentley, Manchester, England, and in
possession of the Bentley family ever since.
Audubon is represented in a green coat, a crimson
cloak with deep fur edging thrown over one
shoulder, and with portfolio in hand.
</p>

<p>
For information concerning this fine but little known portrait,
as well as for the photograph reproduced in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58983/58983-h/58983-h.htm#Page_412">Vol. I, p. 412</a>,
I am indebted to Mr. Ruthven Deane. In 1913, Mr. John Conway
Bentley, a grandson of the former owner, formerly of
Glasgow, but then living in Cheshire, England, attempted to
dispose of the Holmes portrait in this country.
</p>

<p class="plist">
5. <i>1826.</i>—Oil portrait by John Syme; painted at Edinburgh,
November, 1826; supposed to have been
engraved by W. H. Lizars, but no trace of
painting or engraving has been found. See
Maria R. Audubon, <i><a href="#Bibliography_86">op. cit.</a></i>, vol. i, pp. 157
and 165.
</p>

<p>
On November 27, 1826, Audubon wrote: "At twelve I went
to <i>stand up</i> for my picture, and sick enough I was of it by
two; at the request of Mr. Lizars I wear my wolf-skin coat,
and if the head is not a strong likeness, perhaps the coat may
be." In writing to his son, Victor, in 1833 (see <a href="#Page_57">Chapter
XXVII, p. 57</a>), Audubon said: "I am glad to hear of Kidd &amp;
Co.'s publication of Parrots, but I regret that my face should
have been there from Syme's picture, which in my estimation
is none of the best."
</p>

<p class="plist">
6. <i>1828.</i>—Oil portrait painted in London by an American
artist named Parker, in August, 1828; Parker
subsequently accompanied Audubon and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
Swainson to Paris, where he is said to have
executed portraits of Cuvier and Redouté.
On August 25, a few days before starting on
this journey, Audubon wrote: "Mr. Parker has
nearly finished my portrait, which he considers
a good one, and <i>so do I</i>" (Maria R. Audubon,
<i><a href="#Bibliography_86">op. cit.</a></i>, vol. i, p. 303). No further mention
of this painting has been found.
</p>

<p class="plist">
7. <i>1830-31.</i>—Miniature painted on ivory by Frederick
Cruikshank, probably in London, and before
Audubon's return to America on August 2,
1831. This portrait has become well known
through the excellent engraving of it by C.
Turner, A.R.A., first published in London,
"Jany. 12, 1835, for the Proprietor, by Robert
Havell, Print-seller, 77, Oxford Street," with
Audubon's characteristic autograph. Good
copies of the original engraving have become
very rare. (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58983/58983-h/58983-h.htm#i-004">Frontispiece, Vol. I.</a>)
</p>

<p>
Miss Maria R. Audubon possesses a very faint water-color
sketch of the original, which, as she has recently written me,
"was destroyed by fire at Shelbyville, Kentucky, with many
other rare and valuable belongings of my grandmother's, soon
after her death [in 1874]."

8. <i>1833.</i>—Portrait in oils by Henry Inman; half-length,
natural size; in possession of Miss Harriet B.
Audubon. "Mr. Inman has painted my Portrait
in Oil, and <i>I say</i> that it is a truer portrait
of me than even the Miniature" (see
<a href="#Page_39">Chapter XXVII, p. 39</a>). Engraved by H. B.
Hall for the second Octavo Edition of <i>The
Birds of America</i>, published in 1856, and the
same engraving has appeared in later editions
of <i>The Life of John James Audubon, the
Naturalist</i>, edited by Lucy Audubon; for reproduction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>

portrait, see Maria R. Audubon, <i><a href="#Bibliography_86">op. cit.</a></i>, vol. i,
p. 206; and for reproduction of the Hall engraving,
<a href="#i-163">Vol. II, p. 130</a>, of the present work.
</p>

<p>
This portrait, like the Cruikshank miniature, has become
well known through frequent reproduction; both represent the
naturalist at the full meridian of his working powers, and are
among the finest likenesses of him extant.

9. <i>1834.</i>—"John J. Audubon"; portrait drawn and engraved
on steel by J. Brown; published by Geo.
Henderson, 2, Old Bailey, Ludgate Hill, London,
1834. A poor drawing of Audubon, in
hunting dress, published with a biographical
sketch, in an English edition of Cuvier's <i>Le
régne animal</i> (see <a href="#Bibliography_56">Bibliography,  No. 56</a>).
This drawing served as the basis of a wood engraving,
in which Audubon is represented as
a much younger man, three-quarters length,
gun in hand, with thumb on trigger, which appeared
in <i>Gleason's Pictorial</i> for 1852 (see
<a href="#Bibliography_67">Bibliography,  No. 67</a>.).

<p class="plist">
10. (Before) <i>1839</i>.—Life Mask, made in London by Robert
Havell, Junior, and formerly in his possession;
acquired from his daughters, Mrs. Amelia Jane
Lockwood and Miss Marion Elington Havell,
by Mr. John E. Thayer, and by him presented
to Harvard University. For reproduction of
the mask, for excellent photographs of which
I am indebted to Dr. Samuel Henshaw, Director
of the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy,
Harvard University, see <a href="#i-221">Vol. II, p. 188</a>.
</p>

<p>
The original was made from a dark colored plaster (?),
and has a decidedly coarse texture. Mr. Harry P. Havell, who
possesses a replica of the original in wax, writes that he obtained
from the Misses Havell, his cousins, the information
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396' href='#Page_396'>396</a></span>
that this mask was made while Audubon was at their home
in London; the matter was treated in a jocular way, as Audubon
lay upon a sofa with straws in his nose, while submitting
to the rather unpleasant ordeal of having a mold made of his
countenance. Mr. Havell, to whom I am indebted for the substance
of this note, also possesses the silver loving cup, which
Audubon presented to Robert Havell upon the completion of
the second volume of his illustrations in 1834 (see <a href="#Page_192">Chapter
XXXII, p. 192</a>). For notice of another mask by O'Neill, Edinburgh,
1827, see Maria R. Audubon, <i><a href="#Bibliography_86">op. cit.</a></i>, vol. i, p. 205.

11. <i>1838.</i>—Portrait in oils, three-quarters length, by George
P. A. Healy; represents Audubon in hunting
shirt, with flowing collar open at neck, knapsack
at side and gun in hand (see <a href="#i-004">Frontispiece,
Vol. II</a>); painted in London upon the initiative
of the artist, still struggling for recognition.
</p>

<p>
This portrait, with a number of other paintings, was raffled
at Boston, at a later day, when it was won by the artist, who
then gave it to a former patron, Mr. Bradlee, by whom it was
presented to the Boston Society of Natural History, and it
now hangs in the library of that institution. The present reproduction
is from a photograph received through the kindness
of Mr. Ruthven Deane, who still owns the negative, which
was reproduced in Mr. Healy's <i>Reminiscences</i> (see <a href="#Bibliography_197">Bibliography,

18. <i>1844.</i>—Cameo by John C. King, now known only from the
photograph made from a cast of the original
intaglio, which the artist presented to the
father of Mr. O. A. Farwell, of Detroit, in
1871.
</p>

<p>
"My father and Mr. King were great friends, and on one
occasion, when father dropped into Mr. King's studio, he found
Mr. Audubon sitting for the cameo. Mr. King introduced the
two gentlemen and asked them to start a conversation, which
was continued during the sitting. The two men became so
animated in their very interesting conversation that they forgot
where they were, and thus the artist was enabled to catch
the natural and striking expression of the great ornithologist."
See "The King Cameos of Audubon," by C. Hart Merriam
(<a href="#Bibliography_226">Bibl. No. 226</a>), who published the first account of this photograph,
and of the previously mentioned Kennard cast, with
reproductions, in 1908. No trace of the original cameos, which
were cut in shell, has yet been found. The Farwell photograph
has been reproduced as a medallion on the covers of the
present work.

<p class="plist">
19. <i>1848-49</i> (?).—A daguerreotype made by Brady, in New
York, probably before 1850, since it was published
in that year, and a considerable interval
of time is clearly represented between this first
camera likeness and the last which was ever
made of the naturalist (see <a href="#daguerr">No. 20</a>, and <a href="#i-337">Vol. II,
p. 280</a>). This daguerreotype was first published
as a steel engraving by D'Avignon, in Lester's
<i>Gallery of Illustrious Americans</i> (for which it
was, in all probability, originally made), in New
York, 1850 (see <a href="#Bibliography_62">Bibliography,  No. 62</a>).
</p>

<p class="plist">
<span class="i5">The</span> same sun portrait was again engraved
on steel (size 4¼ by 3¼ inches) by Nordheim,
and published by Hermann J. Meyer, 164 William
Street, New York. It also appeared as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' name='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>399</a></span>
wood engraving, brought out by M. P.-A. Cap,
in <i>Le Muséum D'Histoire Naturelle</i>, p. 175,
Paris, 1854: a better reproduction, by the same
process, was given in <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, vol.
xiii, p. 275 (see "Audubon's Story of his
Youth," by Maria R. Audubon, <a href="#Bibliography_40">Bibl. No. 40</a>),
in 1893.
</p>

<p>
The original daguerreotype was finally discovered in the
collections at the National Museum, at Washington, where it
had been deposited by Mrs. Elizabeth Berthoud Grimshaw, a
daughter of Mrs. Nicholas Berthoud, and niece of Mrs. Audubon;
it was again published by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, and Miss
M. R. Audubon, in 1894 (see "The Last Portrait of Audubon,"
<a href="#Bibliography_196">Bibl. No. 196</a>). According to the writers just cited, the daguerreotype
was formerly in possession of Mrs. Gordon, a sister
of Mrs. J. J. Audubon, who gave it to the present owner.

</p>

<p>
The original of this portrait, which was evidently drawn,
with slight changes, from the large painting of the same subject
by John Woodhouse Audubon, executed about 1841 (see
<a href="#jwwportrait">No. 13</a>), is now in possession of Mr. Ruthven Deane, who has
written me that it is done in black and white, like all of Chappel's
work which was designed for the purposes of steel engraving,
and measures 12 by 17 inches. Concerning this artist,
Mr. Arthur Lumley wrote to Mr. Deane on April 26, 1905,
as follows: "I knew Chappel in my boyhood days, when he
ranked next to Felix O. C. Darley as an illustrator; at the same
time he was a good portrait painter in oil. Chappel, in many
ways, was a gifted man, and his historical pictures were fine
in composition and color. He held a high rank, and had no
occasion to seek orders, having all he could do, and at his own
terms; most of his work was reproduced by steel-plate engravings":
Chappel, he adds, who died about 1875, was "a quiet,
genial gentleman who was ever ready to help and guide rising
aspirants in the field of art."

<p>
Besides the published writings of Audubon, I have included
in this Bibliography such references to his life and times as
occur in the text or which possess some degree of merit; all
other important literary and historical authorities are cited in
footnotes to the text. The titles appear in a single numerical
series, but the arrangement under each head is strictly chronological.
All references to this list in the text are indicated
usually by title, with the name of the author, and always by
Arabic numerals, in correspondence with the series which follows.
If some chaff has been admitted to this garner, no corn,
I hope, has been thrown into the fire.

The first ten plates were executed by William Home Lizars,
Edinburgh, 1826-7, but were later retouched or reëngraved (?)
by Robert Havell, Junior, who produced all the rest in London;
printed on Whatman's drawing paper, size (untrimmed),
39½ x 29½ inches, and colored after the originals. A considerable
number of the plain plates were dispersed, and at least one
complete set exists in this state (see <a href="#FN_4">Note, Chapter XXVI,
Vol. II, p. 7</a>, and also <a href="#Page_190">Chapter XXXII, Vol. II, p. 190</a>); scientific
and common names, with legends of author and engraver,
and eventually the date of publication, were given on each plate.
Issued to subscribers at two guineas a Part, and sold in Europe
at £182, 14s; in America, at $1,000. The Turkey Cock (Plate
No. 1) now brings upwards of $140, and perfect sets upwards
of $4,000, according to binding and state. Total number of
original sets probably did not exceed 190 or 200.

In this "miniature" edition, the "delineations of American
scenery and manners" are omitted, the text revised, and the
nomenclature made to conform with the <i>Synopsis</i>; the plates
of the large folio were broken up, and their accessories reduced,
so that but one species appears on each; 7 species, described in
the <i>Biography</i> and <i>Synopsis</i> are figured for the first time in an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>
Appendix, in which also appear 17 species that had been neither
figured nor described before, thus bringing the total number
of birds represented on the octavo plates to 500; four of the
largest birds receive two plates each, thus leaving the number
of distinct species figured at 496, while the 12 species herein described
brings the total number of species recognized by Audubon
in 1844 to 508. The plates of this edition are rearranged
and renumbered to conform with the new arrangement of the
text, which was considerably improved. The series begins with
the California Vulture, and ends with Baird's Bunting.

Vols. I-V were published by J. J. Audubon, New York, and
simultaneously issued by J. B. Chevalier, Philadelphia; Vols.

Sixth and last complete octavo edition of text and plates,
being a reissue of the 1865 edition. In the biography, signed
"G. R. L[ockwood]., 1870," it is stated that Jean Audubon
died "at Rochefort on the Loire [<i>sic</i>], where he had a large
estate" at the age of ninety-five, and that J. J. Audubon was
born on his father's plantation at New Orleans in 1780. This
memoir was issued separately as an advertising pamphlet by
J. L. Sibole ("Fine Book Dealer, 109 So. 15th. Street, New
York"), to exploit the octavo editions of the <i>Birds</i> and <i>Quadrupeds</i>
(pp. 1-15, paper cover, no date).

Audubon is said to have been born in New Orleans, May 4,
1780, and "in 1810 he embarked in a skiff with his wife and
young child for his only companions, and with his gun and
pencil for baggage, and commenced an adventurous and wandering
life—the life of a hunter and naturalist, which he did not
abandon until 1834."

on cover. The editor assumed no responsibility for the fidelity
of his record, which was based on a manuscript by the Rev.
Charles Coffin Adams, of New York. Reproduced in "Everyman's
Library," with an Introduction by John Burroughs
(originally appearing as a review of Buchanan's work in 1869;
see <a href="#Bibliography_153">No. 153</a>). 12mo. Pp. i-xx, 1-336. London and New York

The editor stated that Audubon had spent twenty-two
years in the study of American birds, and that the engravings,
of which several had already appeared, would be accompanied
by a quarto volume of letterpress, containing all his observations
on the natural history of the species, in the form of letters,
an example of which was given in the paper on the Turkey
Buzzard in the present number of that <i>Journal</i> (see <a href="#Bibliography_17">No. 17</a>).

A comparative review of the ornithological works of Alexander
Wilson, Thomas Nuttall, and John James Audubon,
very laudatory of the first two but condemnatory of the last,
by Judge Hall, whose brother, Harrison Hall, was an interested
publisher of Wilson's work. "How shall we venture to
dissent from the almost unanimous expression of public sentiment,
which has set him [Audubon] up as a sort of 'greatest
and best,' against whom to speak in dispraise, would be a species
of treason. Yet it must be done, and it is our vocation
to do it: the critic must not be silent when the interests of science
require, and the honor of his country demands, that he
should proclaim the truth.... The exaggerations contained
in these sketches ["Episodes"] are such as to weaken
our confidence in the entire work."

Ferdinand Freiligrath (1810-1876), well known German
lyric poet and apostle of democracy, was more than once
forced to flee his native land on account of his political sentiments;
he went to England seven years after Audubon had
finally settled in America, and that country became his refuge
for over twenty years; his translations from the English included
Longfellow's poem of "Hiawatha."

John James Abert (1788-1863), long associated with the Bureau of
Topographical Engineers of the United States Army, became brevet
lieutenant-colonel in charge of that office in 1837; according to Ruthven
Deane (see <a href="#Bibliography_216">Bibliography,  No. 216</a>), he was an organizer of the National
Institute of Science, afterwards merged with the Smithsonian Institution
at Washington; an ardent friend of Audubon, he assisted him in many
ways, and, as Dr. Richard Harlan affirmed, paid dearly for his support
by being rejected for membership in the American Philosophical Society
at Philadelphia. Harlan wrote to Audubon on January 27, 1832, that
out of twenty-five members present on the occasion referred to, five, led
by Mr. George Ord, Mr. Isaac Lea, and Dr. Hays, had voted against
him: in his opinion no possible grounds could be found for opposing
so desirable a member excepting his friendship for Audubon and his
support of the snake "Episode" (see <a href="#Chapter_XXVIII">Chapter XXVIII</a>). In 1832 Abert's
paper on the "Habits of Climbing of the Rattlesnake," which was written
in the previous year, had appeared in a Philadelphia journal (see
<a href="#Bibliography_107">Bibliography,  No. 107</a>). To this friend Abert's Squirrel, <i>Sciurus aberti</i>,
was later dedicated; see Audubon, <i>The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North
America</i> (<a href="#Bibliography_6">Bibl. No. 6</a>), plate 153.

The plates thus dedicated were unbound, and apparently in their
original covers, which consisted of plain brown sheets. They passed
through the hands of Messrs. Burrows Brothers' Company, Cleveland, to
Mr. Robert H. Sayre of South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and were
originally received by the American dealers from the Messrs. Sotheran &amp;
Company of London. Possibly this was the set mentioned by Coues, who
says "Trübner ... quotes the work with plain plates. I have never
seen one in that condition" (<i>Birds of the Colorado Valley</i>, p. 612; <a href="#Bibliography_181">Bibl. No.
181</a>). After Mr. Sayre's death, his library was dispersed by public auction
at Philadelphia, when this complete set of Audubon plates, though in an
uncolored state, brought $3,200; see <i>Public Ledger</i>, November 9, 1907, and

made in bringing out some of his plates by lithography. Two copies of
a large plate, possibly the only one produced, lithographed without colors,
were shown to me by Mr. Goodspeed, of Boston, in the summer of 1910;
these represented the "Rallus crepitans—Marsh Hen," and bore the following
legends: "By John J. Audubon, F.R.S., &amp;c., &amp;c.," and "Drawn &amp;
Printed by Childs &amp; Inman, Philadelphia, 1832." Three birds are here
figured in place of the two which appear in the plate of this species which
Havell later engraved, and in composition the two publications are quite

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_69'>[69]</a></span> Bachman's account of these experiments is interesting: "A coarse
painting," he said, was made on canvas, "representing a sheep skinned and
cut open. This proved very amusing—no sooner was this picture placed
on the ground than the Vultures observed it, alighted near, walked over
it, and some of them commenced tugging at the painting. They seemed
much disappointed and surprised, and after having satisfied their curiosity,
flew away. This experiment was repeated more than fifty times, with
the same result. The painting was then placed within two feet of the
place where the offal was deposited—they came as usual, walked around
it, but in no instance evinced the slightest symptoms of their having
scented the offal which was so near them.</p>

<p class="footnote">
"The most offensive portions of the offal were now placed on the earth;
these were covered over by a canvass cloth—on this were strewn several
pieces of fresh beef. The Vultures came, ate the flesh that was in sight,
and although they were standing on a quantity beneath them, and although
their bills were frequently within the eighth of an inch of the putrid
matter, they did not discover it. We made a small rent in the canvass,
and they at once discovered the flesh and began to devour it. We drove
them away, replaced the canvass with a piece that was entire; again they
commenced eating the flesh exhibited to their view, without discovering
the hidden food they were trampling upon.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"As it [the organ of smell] does however exist, (although in an
inferior degree,) I am not disposed to deny to birds the power of smell
altogether, nor would I wish to advance the opinion that the Vulture does
not possess the power of smelling in the slightest degree, (although it has

Society</i>, 112th session (1900): one of "6 June, 1831," announces Audubon's
prospective return to America in August of that year; another, dated
"6 Dec. 1837," asks for the loan of some bird skins; and the last of
"11 Jan. 1838," is reproduced in <a href="#Chapter_XXXII">Chapter XXXII</a>. Swainson is said to have
been negotiating at this time with Charles L. Bonaparte in reference
to a joint compilation for a work on the birds of the world; Bonaparte
estimated that there were then between 7,000 and 8,000 known species
to be characterized, but Swainson's terms were not satisfactory, and
nothing came of the project. To the above list should be added the
letter, evidently misdated, of "April 28th. 1831," soon to follow.

Coues (see <a href="#Bibliography_181">Bibliography,  No. 181</a>), with a question mark, to Swainson,
but the internal evidence shows conclusively that he was not its author.
The writer of this article said that it was not enough to state that
Audubon "has invented a new style in the representation of natural
objects; for so true are his pictures, that he who has once seen and
examined them, can never again look with pleasure on the finest productions
of other artists. To paint like Audubon, will henceforth mean to
represent Nature as she is.... To relieve, as Mr. Audubon says, the
tedium of those who may have imposed upon themselves the task of
following an author through the mazes of descriptive ornithology, he has
interspersed descriptions of American scenery and manners, gloomy forests,
tangled cane-brakes, dismal swamps, majestic rivers, floods, tornadoes, and
earthquakes; the migration of the white man, the retreat of the red;
the character and pursuits of the backwoodsman.... Much, therefore,
is it to be wished that Mr. Audubon would undertake the delineation of
the birds of Great Britain, which, with his matchless talents, aided by
those of Mr. Havell, would eclipse, not only all other representations of
these birds, but even the 'Birds of America,' unrivalled as that work
now is."

Trudeau, out of ignorance or disregard for Swainson's designation, later
named a woodpecker, obtained near New Orleans in 1837, <i>Picus auduboni</i>,

was given by two different naturalists to the same bird, now regarded

<p class="footnote">This first octavo edition of Audubon's <i>Birds</i> was issued by J. J. Audubon,
and J. B. Chevalier, Philadelphia, in 100 parts, of five plates each,
to be bound in 7 volumes, 1840-44. Complete sets in parts are now very
rare; previous to 1907 a set is said to have been sold for $500; in 1914
one was offered in Philadelphia for $750. The introduction to No 1,
is dated "New York, Nov. 1839," and the fifteenth number, beginning
volume ii, "N. Y., Aug., 1840." The first five volumes (1840-42) were
issued with the coöperation of J. B. Chevalier, lithographer, 70 Dock
Street, Philadelphia, but, according to Mr. Ruthven Deane, he was an
agent who received a commission on sales, and, for a time, a share in
the profits, but not a co-publisher with Audubon; it is also stated that
when misfortune visited Chevalier in later life, he was cared for by
Audubon or his sons, up to the time of his death. For fuller details,

474 are sanctioned in the present "Check List" of the American
Ornithologists' Union; seventeen have proved to be identical with others;
ten are extra-limital; two are hybrids; and five have never been found
since; of Audubon's suppressed species, two have been resuscitated. Audubon
is thought to have been personally acquainted with 385 American
species, others being known to him only through specimens sent by collectors,

sales of this work are drawn. The total edition of the plates for No. 2
was 1,345, and of No. 3, 1,339. No. 11 of the plates was the first to run
to 1,000 copies in the first printing, and this issue was continued to No.
50, inclusive, excepting Nos. 3, 28, 29, and 30, of which 1,500 seem to have
been printed; the plates of these numbers were done at the lithographic
establishment of Endicotts, New York, all others being the work of J. T.
Bowen, Philadelphia. When subscriptions began to fall off with No. 51,
the edition was reduced to 1,150, and again with No. 57, to 1,050, which
remained constant to No. 84, or as far as this record goes. Of the text,
printed by E. G. Dorsey, 1,200 copies formed the first edition of No. 1,
1,000 copies that of No. 2, and of successive numbers to No. 23. With
No. 24, the edition was increased to 2,000, and in February, 1841, the
earlier numbers were reprinted, thus forming a second edition of these
parts, and affording a chance for correction of errors. (See Audubon's
letter quoted above.)

rider and shot, then in charge of Fort Union at the mouth of the Yellowstone.
Audubon, with the assistance of Sprague, painted his portrait and
that of his wife, a Blackfoot Indian princess, who also was noted for her
skill in horsemanship. "I lost the head of my first [buffalo] bull head,"
said Audubon, "because I forgot to tell Mrs. Culbertson that I wished
to save it, and the princess had its skull broken open to enjoy its brains.
Handsome, and really courteous and refined in many ways, I cannot reconcile
myself to the fact that she partakes of raw animal food, with such
evident relish." (Maria R. Audubon, <i>Audubon and his Journals</i>, vol. ii,
p. 111).</p>

since August, 1916, and in the spring of 1917 he was promoted from the
ranks "on account of great bravery under unusual conditions;" if still living,
William Audubon and his son are the sole male representatives of the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
